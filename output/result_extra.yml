        CVE-2021-43618:
            Name: CVE-2021-43618
            Description: GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) through 6.2.1
                has an mpz/inp_raw.c integer overflow and resultant buffer overflow
                via crafted input, leading to a segmentation fault on 32-bit platforms.
        CVE-2021-41990:
            Name: CVE-2021-41990
            Description: The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer
                overflow via a crafted certificate with an RSASSA-PSS signature. For
                example, this can be triggered by an unrelated self-signed CA certificate
                sent by an initiator. Remote code execution cannot occur.
        CVE-2018-17540:
            Name: CVE-2018-17540
            Description: The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.7.1 has a Buffer Overflow
                via a crafted certificate.
        CVE-2018-16152:
            Name: CVE-2018-16152
            Description: In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c
                in the gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA
                implementation based on GMP does not reject excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters
                field during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently, a remote
                attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being
                used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA signature
                is used for IKEv2 authentication. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4790
                and CVE-2014-1568.
        CVE-2018-16151:
            Name: CVE-2018-16151
            Description: In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c
                in the gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA
                implementation based on GMP does not reject excess data after the
                encoded algorithm OID during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Similar
                to the flaw in the same version of strongSwan regarding digestAlgorithm.parameters,
                a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents
                are being used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA
                signature is used for IKEv2 authentication.
        CVE-2017-9022:
            Name: CVE-2017-9022
            Description: The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.5.3 does not properly
                validate RSA public keys before calling mpz_powm_sec, which allows
                remote peers to cause a denial of service (floating point exception
                and process crash) via a crafted certificate.
        CVE-2017-7963:
            Name: CVE-2017-7963
            Description: '** DISPUTED ** The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
                (GMP) interfaces for PHP through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a
                denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via operations
                on long strings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating "There is
                no security issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM
                condition. The only attack vector here is denial of service. However,
                if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a
                DoS vector regardless of GMP''s OOM behavior."'
        CVE-2017-5448:
            Name: CVE-2017-5448
            Description: An out-of-bounds write in "ClearKeyDecryptor" while decrypting
                some Clearkey-encrypted media content. The "ClearKeyDecryptor" code
                runs within the Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox. If a second mechanism
                is found to escape the sandbox, this vulnerability allows for the
                writing of arbitrary data within memory, resulting in a potentially
                exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 45.9,
                Firefox ESR < 52.1, and Firefox < 53.
        CVE-2017-11185:
            Name: CVE-2017-11185
            Description: The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.6.0 allows remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon
                crash) via a crafted RSA signature.
        CVE-2016-2837:
            Name: CVE-2016-2837
            Description: Heap-based buffer overflow in the ClearKey Content Decryption
                Module (CDM) in the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) API in Mozilla
                Firefox before 48.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.3 might allow remote
                attackers to execute arbitrary code by providing a malformed video
                and leveraging a Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox bypass.
        CVE-2014-8643:
            Name: CVE-2014-8643
            Description: Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 on Windows allows remote attackers
                to bypass the Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox protection mechanism
                by leveraging access to the GMP process, as demonstrated by the OpenH264
                plugin's process.
        CVE-2013-0727:
            Name: CVE-2013-0727
            Description: Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in Global
                Mapper 14.1.0 allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse
                (1) dwmapi.dll or (2) ibfs32.dll file in the current working directory,
                as demonstrated by a directory that contains a .gmc, .gmg, .gmp, .gms,
                .gmw, or .opt file.
        CVE-2012-2388:
            Name: CVE-2012-2388
            Description: The GMP Plugin in strongSwan 4.2.0 through 4.6.3 allows remote
                attackers to bypass authentication via a (1) empty or (2) zeroed RSA
                signature, aka "RSA signature verification vulnerability."
        CVE-2008-4551:
            Name: CVE-2008-4551
            Description: strongSwan 4.2.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause
                a denial of service (daemon crash) via an IKE_SA_INIT message with
                a large number of NULL values in a Key Exchange payload, which triggers
                a NULL pointer dereference for the return value of the mpz_export
                function in the GNU Multiprecision Library (GMP).
