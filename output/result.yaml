            Description: 'In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery
                can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first
                two bytes) are inadequate. NOTE: this requires that a low public exponent
                (such as 3) is being used. The product, by default, does not generate
                RSA keys with such a low number.'

            Description: New Relic .NET Agent before 6.3.123.0 adds SQL injection
                flaws to safe applications via vectors involving failure to escape
                quotes during use of the Slow Queries feature, as demonstrated by
                a mishandled quote in a VALUES clause of an INSERT statement, after
                bypassing a SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON protection mechanism.
        CVE-2013-0284:

            Description: Ruby agent 3.2.0 through 3.5.2 serializes sensitive data
                when communicating with servers operated by New Relic, which allows
                remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (database credentials
                and SQL statements) by sniffing the network and deserializing the
                data.

            Description: '** DISPUTED ** Crypto++ (aka Cryptopp) 8.6.0 and earlier
                contains a timing leakage in MakePublicKey(). There is a clear correlation
                between execution time and private key length, which may cause disclosure

            Description: The ElGamal implementation in Crypto++ through 8.5 allows
                plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic
                libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by
                the receiver's public key, the generator defined by the receiver's
                public key, and the sender's ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration
                attack against OpenPGP.
        CVE-2019-14318:
            Name: CVE-2019-14318
            Description: Crypto++ 8.3.0 and earlier contains a timing side channel
                in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local or remote attacker,
                able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations,
                to compute the private key used. The issue occurs because scalar multiplication
                in ecp.cpp (prime field curves, small leakage) and algebra.cpp (binary
                field curves, large leakage) is not constant time and leaks the bit
                length of the scalar among other information.

        CVE-2016-9939:
            Name: CVE-2016-9939
            Description: Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a
                bug in its ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a
                memory block based on the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there
                is not enough content octets in the ASN.1 object, then the function
                will fail and the memory block will be zeroed even if its unused.
                There is a noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation.
        CVE-2016-7544:
            Name: CVE-2016-7544
            Description: Crypto++ 5.6.4 incorrectly uses Microsoft's stack-based _malloca
                and _freea functions. The library will request a block of memory to
                align a table in memory. If the table is later reallocated, then the
                wrong pointer could be freed.
        CVE-2016-7420:
            Name: CVE-2016-7420
            Description: Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the
                requirement for a compile-time NDEBUG definition disabling the many
                assert calls that are unintended in production use, which might allow
                context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging
                access to process memory after an assertion failure, as demonstrated
                by reading a core dump.

            Description: matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server
                library in Rust, and matrix-sdk-crypto is the Matrix encryption library.
                Prior to version 0.6, when a user requests a room key from their devices,
                the software correctly remembers the request. When the user receives
                a forwarded room key, the software accepts it without checking who
                the room key came from. This allows homeservers to try to insert room
                keys of questionable validity, potentially mounting an impersonation
                attack. Version 0.6 fixes this issue.
        CVE-2022-2582:
            Name: CVE-2022-2582
            Description: The AWS S3 Crypto SDK sends an unencrypted hash of the plaintext
                alongside the ciphertext as a metadata field. This hash can be used
                to brute force the plaintext, if the hash is readable to the attacker.
                AWS now blocks this metadata field, but older SDK versions still send
                it.
        CVE-2021-32489:
            Name: CVE-2021-32489
            Description: An issue was discovered in the _send_secure_msg() function
                of Yubico yubihsm-shell through 2.0.3. The function does not correctly
                validate the embedded length field of an authenticated message received
                from the device because response_msg.st.len=8 can be accepted but
                triggers an integer overflow, which causes CRYPTO_cbc128_decrypt (in
                OpenSSL) to encounter an undersized buffer and experience a segmentation
                fault. The yubihsm-shell project is included in the YubiHSM 2 SDK
                product.
        CVE-2020-8912:
            Name: CVE-2020-8912
            Description: A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in
                the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker
                with write access to the targeted bucket can change the encryption
                algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to
                change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption
                oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting
                the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic
                equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and
                re-encrypt your files.
        CVE-2020-8911:
            Name: CVE-2020-8911
            Description: A padding oracle vulnerability exists in the AWS S3 Crypto
                SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. The SDK allows users to encrypt
                files with AES-CBC without computing a Message Authentication Code
                (MAC), which then allows an attacker who has write access to the target's
                S3 bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to
                the key can decrypt a file, they can reconstruct the plaintext with
                (on average) 128*length (plaintext) queries to the endpoint, by exploiting
                CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5
                padding errors. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later,
                and re-encrypt your files.
        CVE-2019-0112:
            Name: CVE-2019-0112
            Description: Improper flow control in crypto routines for Intel(R) Data
                Center Manager SDK before version 5.0.2 may allow a privileged user
                to potentially enable a denial of service via local access.
libsodium:

    cve_list:
        CVE-2021-38599:
            Name: CVE-2021-38599
            Description: WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of
                the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used,
                silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext
                backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation
                because "the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity."
        CVE-2020-6018:
            Name: CVE-2020-6018
            Description: Valve's Game Networking Sockets prior to version v1.2.0 improperly
                handles long encrypted messages in function AES_GCM_DecryptContext::Decrypt()
                when compiled using libsodium, leading to a Stack-Based Buffer Overflow
                and resulting in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code
                execution.
        CVE-2019-20138:

    cve_list:
        CVE-2022-39384:
            Name: CVE-2022-39384
            Description: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
                development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions
                that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent
                example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted
                non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it
                can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support
                multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described
                above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution.
                Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with
                contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact
                of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched,
                please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted
                external calls during initialization.
        CVE-2022-39369:
            Name: CVE-2022-39369
            Description: 'phpCAS is an authentication library that allows PHP applications
                to easily authenticate users via a Central Authentication Service
                (CAS) server. The phpCAS library uses HTTP headers to determine the
                service URL used to validate tickets. This allows an attacker to control
                the host header and use a valid ticket granted for any authorized
                service in the same SSO realm (CAS server) to authenticate to the
                service protected by phpCAS. Depending on the settings of the CAS
                server service registry in worst case this may be any other service
                URL (if the allowed URLs are configured to "^(https)://.*") or may
                be strictly limited to known and authorized services in the same SSO
                federation if proper URL service validation is applied. This vulnerability
                may allow an attacker to gain access to a victim''s account on a vulnerable
                CASified service without victim''s knowledge, when the victim visits
                attacker''s website while being logged in to the same CAS server.
                phpCAS 1.6.0 is a major version upgrade that starts enforcing service
                URL discovery validation, because there is unfortunately no 100% safe
                default config to use in PHP. Starting this version, it is required
                to pass in an additional service base URL argument when constructing
                the client class. For more information, please refer to the upgrading
                doc. This vulnerability only impacts the CAS client that the phpCAS
                library protects against. The problematic service URL discovery behavior
                in phpCAS < 1.6.0 will only be disabled, and thus you are not impacted
                from it, if the phpCAS configuration has the following setup: 1. `phpCAS::setUrl()`
                is called (a reminder that you have to pass in the full URL of the
                current page, rather than your service base URL), and 2. `phpCAS::setCallbackURL()`
                is called, only when the proxy mode is enabled. 3. If your PHP''s
                HTTP header input `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Server`, `Host`,
                `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Protocol` is sanitized before reaching
                PHP (by a reverse proxy, for example), you will not be impacted by
                this vulnerability either. If your CAS server service registry is
                configured to only allow known and trusted service URLs the severity
                of the vulnerability is reduced substantially in its severity since
                an attacker must be in control of another authorized service. Otherwise,
                you should upgrade the library to get the safe service discovery behavior.'
        CVE-2022-31109:
            Name: CVE-2022-31109
            Description: laminas-diactoros is a PHP package containing implementations
                of the PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces and PSR-17 HTTP message factory
                interfaces. Applications that use Diactoros, and are either not behind
                a proxy, or can be accessed via untrusted proxies, can potentially
                have the host, protocol, and/or port of a `Laminas\Diactoros\Uri`
                instance associated with the incoming server request modified to reflect
                values from `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Such changes can potentially
                lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or
                URL poisoning. Since the `X-Forwarded-*` headers do have valid use
                cases, particularly in clustered environments using a load balancer,
                the library offers mitigation measures only in the v2 releases, as
                doing otherwise would break these use cases immediately. Users of
                v2 releases from 2.11.1 can provide an additional argument to `Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals()`
                in the form of a `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\RequestFilterInterface`
                instance, including the shipped `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\NoOpRequestFilter`
                implementation which ignores the `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Starting
                in version 3.0, the library will reverse behavior to use the `NoOpRequestFilter`
                by default, and require users to opt-in to `X-Forwarded-*` header
                usage via a configured `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\LegacyXForwardedHeaderFilter`
                instance. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.11.1 or later
                to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may configure web servers
                to reject `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the web server level.
        CVE-2022-31070:
            Name: CVE-2022-31070
            Description: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls.
                Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way
                to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded
                to backend services configured by the application developer. This
                could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to
                such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks
                cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure
                an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config
                setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`.
                Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been
                deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates.
                Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`
                instead.
        CVE-2022-31069:
            Name: CVE-2022-31069
            Description: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls.
                Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way
                to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for
                specific backend services configured by the application developer.
                This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer
                access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should
                not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version
                of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding
                the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken`
                config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this
                library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration
                can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`.
                Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been
                deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates.
                Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`
                instead.
        CVE-2022-24822:
            Name: CVE-2022-24822
            Description: Podium is a library for building micro frontends. @podium/layout
                is a module for building a Podium layout server, and @podium/proxy
                is a module for proxying HTTP requests from a layout server to a podlet
                server. In @podium/layout prior to version 4.6.110 and @podium/proxy
                prior to version 4.2.74, an attacker using the `Trailer` header as
                part of the request against proxy endpoints has the ability to take
                down the server. All Podium layouts that include podlets with proxy
                endpoints are affected. `@podium/layout`, which is the main way developers/users
                are vulnerable to this exploit, has been patched in version `4.6.110`.
                All earlier versions are vulnerable.`@podium/proxy`, which is the
                source of the vulnerability and is used by `@podium/layout` has been
                patched in version `4.2.74`. All earlier versions are vulnerable.
                It is not easily possible to work around this issue without upgrading.
        CVE-2022-21698:
            Name: CVE-2022-21698
            Description: client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications
                in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides
                tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to
                version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service
                through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when
                handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected,
                an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*`
                middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods
                (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name
                to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters
                away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1
                contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available,
                including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used
                in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers;
                adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize
                the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy
                or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set
                of methods.
        CVE-2022-21671:
            Name: CVE-2022-21671
            Description: '@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit''s
                container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive
                information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library
                as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone
                fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through
                a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback
                poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication
                done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is
                outside of Replit''s control and the token used to connect to the
                Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise
                of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1
                by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to
                the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for
                the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information
                about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.'
        CVE-2021-32715:
            Name: CVE-2021-32715
            Description: 'hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper''s HTTP/1 server
                code had a flaw that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with
                a `Content-Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when it should
                have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP
                proxy that doesn''t parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards
                them, can result in "request smuggling" or "desync attacks". The flaw
                exists in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with
                `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version
                0.14.10. Two workarounds exist: One may reject requests manually that
                contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header or ensure
                any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign
                prefix.'
        CVE-2021-32714:
            Name: CVE-2021-32714
            Description: hyper is an HTTP library for Rust. In versions prior to 0.14.10,
                hyper's HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger
                an integer overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This
                allows possible data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy
                that allows chunk sizes larger than hyper does, can result in "request
                smuggling" or "desync attacks." The vulnerability is patched in version
                0.14.10. Two possible workarounds exist. One may reject requests manually
                that contain a `Transfer-Encoding` header or ensure any upstream proxy
                rejects `Transfer-Encoding` chunk sizes greater than what fits in
                64-bit unsigned integers.
        CVE-2021-28363:
            Name: CVE-2021-28363
            Description: The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits
                SSL certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS
                proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext
                isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate.
                This means certificates for different servers that still validate
                properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.
        CVE-2021-21299:
            Name: CVE-2021-21299
            Description: 'hyper is an open-source HTTP library for Rust (crates.io).
                In hyper from version 0.12.0 and before versions 0.13.10 and 0.14.3
                there is a vulnerability that can enable a request smuggling attack.
                The HTTP server code had a flaw that incorrectly understands some
                requests with multiple transfer-encoding headers to have a chunked
                payload, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined
                with an upstream HTTP proxy that understands the request payload boundary
                differently can result in "request smuggling" or "desync attacks".
                To determine if vulnerable, all these things must be true: 1) Using
                hyper as an HTTP server (the client is not affected), 2) Using HTTP/1.1
                (HTTP/2 does not use transfer-encoding), 3) Using a vulnerable HTTP
                proxy upstream to hyper. If an upstream proxy correctly rejects the
                illegal transfer-encoding headers, the desync attack cannot succeed.
                If there is no proxy upstream of hyper, hyper cannot start the desync
                attack, as the client will repair the headers before forwarding. This
                is fixed in versions 0.14.3 and 0.13.10. As a workaround one can take
                the following options: 1) Reject requests that contain a `transfer-encoding`
                header, 2) Ensure any upstream proxy handles `transfer-encoding` correctly.'
        CVE-2021-21295:
            Name: CVE-2021-21295
            Description: 'Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network
                application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance
                protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2)
                before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables
                request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the original
                HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler`
                as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is not
                proxied through as HTTP/1.1. If the request comes in as an HTTP/2
                stream, gets converted into the HTTP/1.1 domain objects (`HttpRequest`,
                `HttpContent`, etc.) via `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then
                sent up to the child channel''s pipeline and proxied through a remote
                peer as HTTP/1.1 this may result in request smuggling. In a proxy
                case, users may assume the content-length is validated somehow, which
                is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel
                that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has meaning
                and needs to be checked. An attacker can smuggle requests inside the
                body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1. For an example
                attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only affected
                if all of this is true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec`
                is used, `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to
                HTTP/1.1 objects, and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another
                remote peer. This has been patched in 4.1.60.Final As a workaround,
                the user can do the validation by themselves by implementing a custom
                `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind
                `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.'
        CVE-2021-21234:
            Name: CVE-2021-21234
            Description: spring-boot-actuator-logview in a library that adds a simple
                logfile viewer as spring boot actuator endpoint. It is maven package
                "eu.hinsch:spring-boot-actuator-logview". In spring-boot-actuator-logview
                before version 0.2.13 there is a directory traversal vulnerability.
                The nature of this library is to expose a log file directory via admin
                (spring boot actuator) HTTP endpoints. Both the filename to view and
                a base folder (relative to the logging folder root) can be specified
                via request parameters. While the filename parameter was checked to
                prevent directory traversal exploits (so that `filename=../somefile`
                would not work), the base folder parameter was not sufficiently checked,
                so that `filename=somefile&base=../` could access a file outside the
                logging base directory). The vulnerability has been patched in release
                0.2.13. Any users of 0.2.12 should be able to update without any issues
                as there are no other changes in that release. There is no workaround
                to fix the vulnerability other than updating or removing the dependency.
                However, removing read access of the user the application is run with
                to any directory not required for running the application can limit
                the impact. Additionally, access to the logview endpoint can be limited
                by deploying the application behind a reverse proxy.

                check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory
                tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance.
                To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0
                or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain
                option. This can result in read/write access to private data such
                as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing
                tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls,
                this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code
                execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting
                in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of
                the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist.
                As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed
                OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration,
                which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.
        CVE-2021-37630:
            Name: CVE-2021-37630
            Description: Nextcloud Circles is an open source social network built
                for the nextcloud ecosystem. In affected versions the Nextcloud Circles
                application allowed any user to join any "Secret Circle" without approval
                by the Circle owner leaking private information. It is recommended
                that Nextcloud Circles is upgraded to 0.19.15, 0.20.11 or 0.21.4.
                There are no workarounds for this issue.
        CVE-2019-15809:
            Name: CVE-2019-15809
            Description: Smart cards from the Athena SCS manufacturer, based on the
                Atmel Toolbox 00.03.11.05 and the AT90SC chip, contain a timing side
                channel in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local attacker,
                able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations,
                to compute the private key used. The issue occurs because the Atmel
                Toolbox 00.03.11.05 contains two versions of ECDSA signature functions,
                described as fast and secure, but the affected cards chose to use
                the fast version, which leaks the bit length of the random nonce via
                timing. This affects Athena IDProtect 010b.0352.0005, Athena IDProtect
                010e.1245.0002, Athena IDProtect 0106.0130.0401, Athena IDProtect

                Armored Card 108.0264.0001.
        CVE-2019-14318:
            Name: CVE-2019-14318
            Description: Crypto++ 8.3.0 and earlier contains a timing side channel
                in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local or remote attacker,
                able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations,
                to compute the private key used. The issue occurs because scalar multiplication
                in ecp.cpp (prime field curves, small leakage) and algebra.cpp (binary
                field curves, large leakage) is not constant time and leaks the bit
                length of the scalar among other information.
        CVE-2019-14317:
            Name: CVE-2019-14317
            Description: wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as
                CyaSSL) generate biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker
                to compute the long term private key from several hundred DSA signatures
                via a lattice attack. The issue occurs because dsa.c fixes two bits
                of the generated nonces.

        CVE-2022-45146:
            Name: CVE-2022-45146
            Description: 'An issue was discovered in the FIPS Java API of Bouncy Castle
                BC-FJA before 1.0.2.4. Changes to the JVM garbage collector in Java
                13 and later trigger an issue in the BC-FJA FIPS modules where it
                is possible for temporary keys used by the module to be zeroed out
                while still in use by the module, resulting in errors or potential
                information loss. NOTE: FIPS compliant users are unaffected because
                the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8, and 11.'
        CVE-2020-28052:
            Name: CVE-2020-28052
            Description: An issue was discovered in Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC
                Java 1.65 and 1.66. The OpenBSDBCrypt.checkPassword utility method
                compared incorrect data when checking the password, allowing incorrect
                passwords to indicate they were matching with previously hashed ones
                that were different.
        CVE-2020-26939:
            Name: CVE-2020-26939
            Description: In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA
                before 1.0.1.2, attackers can obtain sensitive information about a
                private exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to
                Error Inputs. This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding.
                Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the
                OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially
                leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private
                key performing the encryption.
        CVE-2020-15522:
            Name: CVE-2020-15522
            Description: Bouncy Castle BC Java before 1.66, BC C# .NET before 1.8.7,
                BC-FJA before 1.0.1.2, 1.0.2.1, and BC-FNA before 1.0.1.1 have a timing
                issue within the EC math library that can expose information about
                the private key when an attacker is able to observe timing information
                for the generation of multiple deterministic ECDSA signatures.
        CVE-2019-17359:
            Name: CVE-2019-17359
            Description: The ASN.1 parser in Bouncy Castle Crypto (aka BC Java) 1.63
                can trigger a large attempted memory allocation, and resultant OutOfMemoryError
                error, via crafted ASN.1 data. This is fixed in 1.64.
        CVE-2018-5382:
            Name: CVE-2018-5382
            Description: The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits
                long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a
                BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to
                a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS
                keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need
                to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type "BKS-V1"
                was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of "BKS-V1"
                is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where
                it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum
                for the file integrity check is not going to cause a security issue
                in itself.
        CVE-2018-1000613:
            Name: CVE-2018-1000613
            Description: 'Legion of the Bouncy Castle Legion of the Bouncy Castle
                Java Cryptography APIs 1.58 up to but not including 1.60 contains

        CVE-2018-1000180:
            Name: CVE-2018-1000180
            Description: Bouncy Castle BC 1.54 - 1.59, BC-FJA 1.0.0, BC-FJA 1.0.1
                and earlier have a flaw in the Low-level interface to RSA key pair
                generator, specifically RSA Key Pairs generated in low-level API with
                added certainty may have less M-R tests than expected. This appears
                to be fixed in versions BC 1.60 beta 4 and later, BC-FJA 1.0.2 and
                later.
        CVE-2016-2427:
            Name: CVE-2016-2427
            Description: '** DISPUTED ** The AES-GCM specification in RFC 5084, as
                used in Android 5.x and 6.x, recommends 12 octets for the aes-ICVlen
                parameter field, which might make it easier for attackers to defeat
                a cryptographic protection mechanism and discover an authentication
                key via a crafted application, aka internal bug 26234568.  NOTE: The
                vendor disputes the existence of this potential issue in Android,
                stating "This CVE was raised in error: it referred to the authentication
                tag size in GCM, whose default according to ASN.1 encoding (12 bytes)
                can lead to vulnerabilities. After careful consideration, it was decided
                that the insecure default value of 12 bytes was a default only for
                the encoding and not default anywhere else in Android, and hence no
                vulnerability existed."'
        CVE-2016-1000352:

            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                the ECIES implementation allowed the use of ECB mode. This mode is
                regarded as unsafe and support for it has been removed from the provider.
        CVE-2016-1000346:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000346
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                the other party DH public key is not fully validated. This can cause
                issues as invalid keys can be used to reveal details about the other
                party's private key where static Diffie-Hellman is in use. As of release
                1.56 the key parameters are checked on agreement calculation.
        CVE-2016-1000345:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000345
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                the DHIES/ECIES CBC mode vulnerable to padding oracle attack. For
                BC 1.55 and older, in an environment where timings can be easily observed,
                it is possible with enough observations to identify when the decryption
                is failing due to padding.
        CVE-2016-1000344:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000344
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                the DHIES implementation allowed the use of ECB mode. This mode is
                regarded as unsafe and support for it has been removed from the provider.
        CVE-2016-1000343:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000343
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                the DSA key pair generator generates a weak private key if used with
                default values. If the JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised
                with DSA parameters, 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming
                a 1024 bit key size. In earlier releases this can be dealt with by
                explicitly passing parameters to the key pair generator.
        CVE-2016-1000342:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000342
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                ECDSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification.
                It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up
                the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may
                allow the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed structure.
        CVE-2016-1000341:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000341
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                DSA signature generation is vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings
                can be closely observed for the generation of signatures, the lack
                of blinding in 1.55, or earlier, may allow an attacker to gain information
                about the signature's k value and ultimately the private value as
                well.
        CVE-2016-1000340:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000340
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.51 to 1.55,
                a carry propagation bug was introduced in the implementation of squaring
                for several raw math classes have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???).
                These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations
                (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so there was the possibility
                of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve
                scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with
                high probability by the output validation for our scalar multipliers.
        CVE-2016-1000339:
            Name: CVE-2016-1000339
            Description: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier
                the primary engine class used for AES was AESFastEngine. Due to the
                highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out that
                if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses
                are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used. There
                was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine
                has been modified to remove any signs of leakage (testing carried
                out on Intel X86-64) and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE
                provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine is now only recommended where
                otherwise deemed appropriate.

                DSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification.
                It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up
                the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may

            Description: The Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.51 does not validate
                a point is withing the elliptic curve, which makes it easier for remote
                attackers to obtain private keys via a series of crafted elliptic
                curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges, aka an "invalid curve attack."
        CVE-2015-6644:
            Name: CVE-2015-6644
            Description: Bouncy Castle in Android before 5.1.1 LMY49F and 6.0 before
                2016-01-01 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via a
                crafted application, aka internal bug 24106146.
        CVE-2013-1624:
            Name: CVE-2013-1624
            Description: The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library
                before 1.48 and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing
                side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during
                the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers
                to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
                statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related
                issue to CVE-2013-0169.
        CVE-2007-6721:
            Name: CVE-2007-6721
            Description: The Legion of the Bouncy Castle Java Cryptography API before

            Description: In Botan before 2.19.3, it is possible to forge OCSP responses
                due to a certificate verification error. This issue was introduced
                in Botan 1.11.34 (November 2016).
        CVE-2021-40529:
            Name: CVE-2021-40529
            Description: The ElGamal implementation in Botan through 2.18.1, as used
                in Thunderbird and other products, allows plaintext recovery because,
                during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain
                dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver's public
                key, the generator defined by the receiver's public key, and the sender's
                ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against
                OpenPGP.
        CVE-2021-24115:
            Name: CVE-2021-24115
            Description: In Botan before 2.17.3, constant-time computations are not
                used for certain decoding and encoding operations (base32, base58,
                base64, and hex).
        CVE-2018-9860:
            Name: CVE-2018-9860
            Description: An issue was discovered in Botan 1.11.32 through 2.x before
                2.6.0. An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext
                could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation
                exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read.
                The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will
                be closed. This could be used for denial of service. No information
                leak occurs.
        CVE-2018-9127:
            Name: CVE-2018-9127
            Description: Botan 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 (fixed in 2.5.0) improperly handled wildcard
                certificates and could accept certain certificates as valid for hostnames
                when, under RFC 6125 rules, they should not match. This only affects
                certificates issued to the same domain as the host, so to impersonate
                a host one must already have a wildcard certificate matching other
                hosts in the same domain. For example, b*.example.com would match
                some hostnames that do not begin with a 'b' character.
        CVE-2018-20187:
            Name: CVE-2018-20187
            Description: A side-channel issue was discovered in Botan before 2.9.0.
                An attacker capable of precisely measuring the time taken for ECC
                key generation may be able to derive information about the high bits
                of the secret key, as the function to derive the public point from
                the secret scalar uses an unblinded Montgomery ladder whose loop iteration
                count depends on the bitlength of the secret. This issue affects only
                key generation, not ECDSA signatures or ECDH key agreement.
        CVE-2018-12435:
            Name: CVE-2018-12435
            Description: Botan 2.5.0 through 2.6.0 before 2.7.0 allows a memory-cache
                side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden
                Number Problem or ROHNP, related to dsa/dsa.cpp, ec_group/ec_group.cpp,
                and ecdsa/ecdsa.cpp. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs
                access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine
                on the same physical host.
        CVE-2017-2801:
            Name: CVE-2017-2801
            Description: A programming error exists in a way Randombit Botan cryptographic
                library version 2.0.1 implements x500 string comparisons which could
                lead to certificate verification issues and abuse. A specially crafted
                X509 certificate would need to be delivered to the client or server
                application in order to trigger this vulnerability.
        CVE-2017-14737:
            Name: CVE-2017-14737
            Description: A cryptographic cache-based side channel in the RSA implementation
                in Botan before 1.10.17, and 1.11.x and 2.x before 2.3.0, allows a
                local attacker to recover information about RSA secret keys, as demonstrated
                by CacheD. This occurs because an array is indexed with bits derived
                from a secret key.
        CVE-2016-9132:
            Name: CVE-2016-9132
            Description: In Botan 1.8.0 through 1.11.33, when decoding BER data an
                integer overflow could occur, which would cause an incorrect length
                field to be computed. Some API callers may use the returned (incorrect
                and attacker controlled) length field in a way which later causes
                memory corruption or other failure.
        CVE-2016-8871:
            Name: CVE-2016-8871
            Description: In Botan 1.11.29 through 1.11.32, RSA decryption with certain
                padding options had a detectable timing channel which could given
                sufficient queries be used to recover plaintext, aka an "OAEP side
                channel" attack.
        CVE-2016-6879:
            Name: CVE-2016-6879

                2.7.x before 2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel
                measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing
                the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by
                exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates;
                (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003
                to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective
                coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack
                to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the
                signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient access when
                attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.

                handled specially crafted ciphertext. An attacker could use this flaw
                to provide a manipulated ciphertext leading to application crash and
                denial of service.
        CVE-2021-20305:
            Name: CVE-2021-20305
            Description: A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where
                several Nettle signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA &
                ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply
                function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting
                in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid
                signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The
                highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity,
                as well as system availability.
        CVE-2018-16869:
            Name: CVE-2018-16869
            Description: A Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding oracle attack
                was found in the way nettle handles endian conversion of RSA decrypted
                PKCS#1 v1.5 data. An attacker who is able to run a process on the
                same physical core as the victim process, could use this flaw extract
                plaintext or in some cases downgrade any TLS connections to a vulnerable
                server.
        CVE-2016-6489:
            Name: CVE-2016-6489

        CVE-2019-13050:
            Name: CVE-2019-13050
            Description: Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0
                of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky
                to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on
                the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause
                a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming
                Attack.
        CVE-2018-9234:
            Name: CVE-2018-9234
            Description: GnuPG 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 does not enforce a configuration in
                which key certification requires an offline master Certify key, which
                results in apparently valid certifications that occurred only with
                access to a signing subkey.
        CVE-2018-19205:
            Name: CVE-2018-19205
            Description: Roundcube before 1.3.7 mishandles GnuPG MDC integrity-protection
                warnings, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive

        CVE-2018-12356:
            Name: CVE-2018-12356
            Description: An issue was discovered in password-store.sh in pass in Simple
                Password Store 1.7.x before 1.7.2. The signature verification routine
                parses the output of GnuPG with an incomplete regular expression,
                which allows remote attackers to spoof file signatures on configuration
                files and extension scripts. Modifying the configuration file allows
                the attacker to inject additional encryption keys under their control,
                thereby disclosing passwords to the attacker. Modifying the extension
                scripts allows the attacker arbitrary code execution.
        CVE-2018-12020:
            Name: CVE-2018-12020
            Description: mainproc.c in GnuPG before 2.2.8 mishandles the original
                filename during decryption and verification actions, which allows
                remote attackers to spoof the output that GnuPG sends on file descriptor
                2 to other programs that use the "--status-fd 2" option. For example,
                the OpenPGP data might represent an original filename that contains
                line feed characters in conjunction with GOODSIG or VALIDSIG status
                codes.
        CVE-2018-1000858:

        CVE-2016-1404:
            Name: CVE-2016-1404
            Description: Cisco UCS Invicta 4.3, 4.5, and 5.0.1 on Invicta appliances
                and Invicta Scaling System uses the same hardcoded GnuPG encryption
                key across different customers' installations, which allows remote
                attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by sniffing
                network traffic to an Autosupport server and leveraging knowledge
                of this key from another installation, aka Bug ID CSCur85504.

        CVE-2014-5270:
            Name: CVE-2014-5270
            Description: Libgcrypt before 1.5.4, as used in GnuPG and other products,
                does not properly perform ciphertext normalization and ciphertext
                randomization, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers
                to conduct key-extraction attacks by leveraging the ability to collect
                voltage data from exposed metal, a different vector than CVE-2013-4576.
        CVE-2014-4617:
            Name: CVE-2014-4617

            Description: 'GnuPG 1.x before 1.4.16 generates RSA keys using sequences
                of introductions with certain patterns that introduce a side channel,
                which allows physically proximate attackers to extract RSA keys via
                a chosen-ciphertext attack and acoustic cryptanalysis during decryption.
                NOTE: applications are not typically expected to protect themselves
                from acoustic side-channel attacks, since this is arguably the responsibility

                GnuPG 2.0.x and possibly other products, allows local users to obtain
                private RSA keys via a cache side-channel attack involving the L3
                cache, aka Flush+Reload.
        CVE-2012-6581:
            Name: CVE-2012-6581
            Description: Best Practical Solutions RT 3.8.x before 3.8.15 and 4.0.x
                before 4.0.8, when GnuPG is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass
                intended restrictions on reading keys in the product's keyring, and
                trigger outbound e-mail messages signed by an arbitrary stored secret
                key, by leveraging a UI e-mail signing privilege.
        CVE-2012-6580:
            Name: CVE-2012-6580
            Description: Best Practical Solutions RT 3.8.x before 3.8.15 and 4.0.x
                before 4.0.8, when GnuPG is enabled, does not ensure that the UI labels
                unencrypted messages as unencrypted, which might make it easier for
                remote attackers to spoof details of a message's origin or interfere
                with encryption-policy auditing via an e-mail message to a queue's
                address.
        CVE-2012-6579:
            Name: CVE-2012-6579
            Description: Best Practical Solutions RT 3.8.x before 3.8.15 and 4.0.x
                before 4.0.8, when GnuPG is enabled, allows remote attackers to configure
                encryption or signing for certain outbound e-mail, and possibly cause
                a denial of service (loss of e-mail readability), via an e-mail message
                to a queue's address.
        CVE-2012-6578:
            Name: CVE-2012-6578
            Description: Best Practical Solutions RT 3.8.x before 3.8.15 and 4.0.x
                before 4.0.8, when GnuPG is enabled with a "Sign by default" queue
                configuration, uses a queue's key for signing, which might allow remote
                attackers to spoof messages by leveraging the lack of authentication
                semantics.
        CVE-2012-6085:
            Name: CVE-2012-6085
            Description: The read_block function in g10/import.c in GnuPG 1.4.x before

        CVE-2006-6235:
            Name: CVE-2006-6235
            Description: A "stack overwrite" vulnerability in GnuPG (gpg) 1.x before
                1.4.6, 2.x before 2.0.2, and 1.9.0 through 1.9.95 allows attackers
                to execute arbitrary code via crafted OpenPGP packets that cause GnuPG
                to dereference a function pointer from deallocated stack memory.
        CVE-2006-6169:
            Name: CVE-2006-6169
            Description: Heap-based buffer overflow in the ask_outfile_name function
                in openfile.c for GnuPG (gpg) 1.4 and 2.0, when running interactively,
                might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via messages with
                "C-escape" expansions, which cause the make_printable_string function
                to return a longer string than expected while constructing a prompt.
        CVE-2006-3746:
            Name: CVE-2006-3746
            Description: Integer overflow in parse_comment in GnuPG (gpg) 1.4.4 allows
                remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
                via a crafted message.
        CVE-2006-3082:
            Name: CVE-2006-3082
            Description: parse-packet.c in GnuPG (gpg) 1.4.3 and 1.9.20, and earlier
                versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (gpg
                crash) and possibly overwrite memory via a message packet with a large
                length (long user ID string), which could lead to an integer overflow,
                as demonstrated using the --no-armor option.
        CVE-2006-0455:
            Name: CVE-2006-0455
            Description: 'gpgv in GnuPG before 1.4.2.1, when using unattended signature
                verification, returns a 0 exit code in certain cases even when the
                detached signature file does not carry a signature, which could cause
                programs that use gpgv to assume that the signature verification has
                succeeded. Note: this also occurs when running the equivalent command
                "gpg --verify".'
        CVE-2006-0049:
            Name: CVE-2006-0049
            Description: gpg in GnuPG before 1.4.2.2 does not properly verify non-detached
                signatures, which allows attackers to inject unsigned data via a data
                packet that is not associated with a control packet, which causes
                the check for concatenated signatures to report that the signature
                is valid, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0455.
        CVE-2003-0978:
            Name: CVE-2003-0978
            Description: Format string vulnerability in gpgkeys_hkp (experimental
                HKP interface) for the GnuPG (gpg) client 1.2.3 and earlier, and 1.3.3
                and earlier, allows remote attackers or a malicious keyserver to cause
                a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code during
                key retrieval.
        CVE-2003-0971:
            Name: CVE-2003-0971
            Description: GnuPG (GPG) 1.0.2, and other versions up to 1.2.3, creates
                ElGamal type 20 (sign+encrypt) keys using the same key component for
                encryption as for signing, which allows attackers to determine the
                private key from a signature.
        CVE-2003-0256:
            Name: CVE-2003-0256
            Description: The GnuPG plugin in kopete before 0.6.2 does not properly
                cleanse the command line when executing gpg, which allows remote attackers
                to execute arbitrary commands.
        CVE-2003-0255:
            Name: CVE-2003-0255
            Description: The key validation code in GnuPG before 1.2.2 does not properly
                determine the validity of keys with multiple user IDs and assigns
                the greatest validity of the most valid user ID, which prevents GnuPG
                from warning the encrypting user when a user ID does not have a trusted
                path.
        CVE-2001-0522:
            Name: CVE-2001-0522
            Description: Format string vulnerability in Gnu Privacy Guard (aka GnuPG
                or gpg) 1.05 and earlier can allow an attacker to gain privileges
                via format strings in the original filename that is stored in an encrypted
                file.
        CVE-2001-0273:
            Name: CVE-2001-0273
            Description: pgp4pine Pine/PGP interface version 1.75-6 does not properly
                check to see if a public key has expired when obtaining the keys via
                Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG), which causes the message to be sent in
                cleartext.
        CVE-2001-0072:
            Name: CVE-2001-0072
            Description: gpg (aka GnuPG) 1.0.4 and other versions imports both public
                and private keys from public key servers without notifying the user
                about the private keys, which could allow an attacker to break the
                web of trust.
        CVE-2001-0071:
            Name: CVE-2001-0071
            Description: gpg (aka GnuPG) 1.0.4 and other versions does not properly
                verify detached signatures, which allows attackers to modify the contents
                of a file without detection.
        CVE-2000-1214:
            Name: CVE-2000-1214
            Description: Buffer overflows in the (1) outpack or (2) buf variables
                of ping in iputils before 20001010, as distributed on Red Hat Linux
                6.2 through 7J and other operating systems, may allow local users
                to gain privileges.
        CVE-2000-1213:
            Name: CVE-2000-1213
            Description: ping in iputils before 20001010, as distributed on Red Hat
                Linux 6.2 through 7J and other operating systems, does not drop privileges
                after acquiring a raw socket, which increases ping's exposure to bugs
                that otherwise would occur at lower privileges.
        CVE-2000-1040:
            Name: CVE-2000-1040
            Description: Format string vulnerability in logging function of ypbind
                3.3, while running in debug mode, leaks file descriptors and allows
                an attacker to cause a denial of service.
        CVE-2000-0974:
            Name: CVE-2000-0974
            Description: GnuPG (gpg) 1.0.3 does not properly check all signatures
                of a file containing multiple documents, which allows an attacker
                to modify contents of all documents but the first without detection.
LibTomCrypt:
    number: 6
    cve_list:
        CVE-2019-17362:
            Name: CVE-2019-17362
            Description: In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string
                function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain
                invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to
                cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information
                from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data.
        CVE-2018-12437:
            Name: CVE-2018-12437
            Description: LibTomCrypt through 1.18.1 allows a memory-cache side-channel
                attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem
                or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either
                the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical
                host.
        CVE-2017-1000412:
            Name: CVE-2017-1000412
            Description: Linaro's open source TEE solution called OP-TEE, version
                2.4.0 (and older) is vulnerable to the bellcore attack in the LibTomCrypt
                code resulting in compromised private RSA key.
        CVE-2016-6129:
            Name: CVE-2016-6129
            Description: The rsa_verify_hash_ex function in rsa_verify_hash.c in LibTomCrypt,
                as used in OP-TEE before 2.2.0, does not validate that the message
                length is equal to the ASN.1 encoded data length, which makes it easier
                for remote attackers to forge RSA signatures or public certificates
                by leveraging a Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack.
        CVE-2016-10335:
            Name: CVE-2016-10335
            Description: In all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel,
                libtomcrypt was updated.
        CVE-2005-1600:
            Name: CVE-2005-1600
            Description: A "mathematical flaw" in the implementation of the El Gamal
                signature algorithm for LibTomCrypt 1.0 to 1.0.2 allows attackers
                to generate valid signatures without having the private key.
wolfSSL:
    number: 61
    cve_list:
        CVE-2022-42961:
            Name: CVE-2022-42961
            Description: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. A fault
                injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure.
                Users performing signing operations with private ECC keys, such as
                in server-side TLS connections, might leak faulty ECC signatures.
                These signatures can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA
                key recovery. (In 5.5.0 and later, WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS can be
                used to address the vulnerability.)
        CVE-2022-42905:
            Name: CVE-2022-42905
            Description: In wolfSSL before 5.5.2, if callback functions are enabled
                (via the WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS flag), then a malicious TLS 1.3 client
                or network attacker can trigger a buffer over-read on the heap of
                5 bytes. (WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS is only intended for debugging.)
        CVE-2022-39173:
            Name: CVE-2022-39173
            Description: 'In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer
                overflow during a TLS 1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker
                supposedly resumes a previous TLS session. During the resumption Client
                Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos
                are required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger
                the buffer overflow. In total, two Client Hellos have to be sent:
                one in the resumed session, and a second one as a response to a Hello
                Retry Request message.'
        CVE-2022-38153:
            Name: CVE-2022-38153
            Description: 'An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when --enable-session-ticket
                is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is exploitable. Man-in-the-middle
                attackers or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2 clients during a
                handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket (more than 256 bytes)
                into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2 handshake, and the client
                has a non-empty session cache, the session cache frees a pointer that
                points to unallocated memory, causing the client to crash with a "free():
                invalid pointer" message. NOTE: It is likely that this is also exploitable
                during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a malicious server.
                With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as a man-in-the-middle.'
        CVE-2022-38152:
            Name: CVE-2022-38152
            Description: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS
                1.3 client connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on
                its session, the server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs
                in the second session, which is created through TLS session resumption
                and reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous
                session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL*
                ssl) on it, the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous
                session) crashes the server. Note that this bug is only triggered
                when resuming sessions using TLS session resumption. Only servers
                that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended SSL_free; SSL_new
                sequence are affected. Furthermore, wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's
                compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part
                of wolfSSL's native API.
        CVE-2022-34293:
            Name: CVE-2022-34293
            Description: wolfSSL before 5.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
                of service via DTLS because a check for return-routability can be
                skipped.
        CVE-2022-25640:
            Name: CVE-2022-25640
            Description: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, a TLS 1.3 server cannot properly
                enforce a requirement for mutual authentication. A client can simply
                omit the certificate_verify message from the handshake, and never
                present a certificate.
        CVE-2022-25638:
            Name: CVE-2022-25638
            Description: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, certificate validation may be bypassed
                during attempted authentication by a TLS 1.3 client to a TLS 1.3 server.
                This occurs when the sig_algo field differs between the certificate_verify
                message and the certificate message.
        CVE-2022-23408:
            Name: CVE-2022-23408
            Description: wolfSSL 5.x before 5.1.1 uses non-random IV values in certain
                situations. This affects connections (without AEAD) using AES-CBC
                or DES3 with TLS 1.1 or 1.2 or DTLS 1.1 or 1.2. This occurs because
                of misplaced memory initialization in BuildMessage in internal.c.
        CVE-2021-46744:
            Name: CVE-2021-46744
            Description: An attacker with access to a malicious hypervisor may be

        CVE-2021-44718:
            Name: CVE-2021-44718
            Description: wolfSSL through 5.0.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial
                of service and infinite loop in the client component by sending crafted
                traffic from a Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) position. The root cause
                is that the client module accepts TLS messages that normally are only
                sent to TLS servers.
        CVE-2021-38597:
            Name: CVE-2021-38597
            Description: wolfSSL before 4.8.1 incorrectly skips OCSP verification
                in certain situations of irrelevant response data that contains the
                NoCheck extension.
        CVE-2021-37155:

            Description: wolfSSL 4.6.x through 4.7.x before 4.8.0 does not produce
                a failure outcome when the serial number in an OCSP request differs
                from the serial number in the OCSP response.
        CVE-2021-3336:
            Name: CVE-2021-3336
            Description: DoTls13CertificateVerify in tls13.c in wolfSSL before 4.7.0
                does not cease processing for certain anomalous peer behavior (sending
                an ED22519, ED448, ECC, or RSA signature without the corresponding
                certificate). The client side is affected because man-in-the-middle
                attackers can impersonate TLS 1.3 servers.
        CVE-2021-24116:
            Name: CVE-2021-24116
            Description: In wolfSSL through 4.6.0, a side-channel vulnerability in
                base64 PEM file decoding allows system-level (administrator) attackers
                to obtain information about secret RSA keys via a controlled-channel
                and side-channel attack on software running in isolated environments
                that can be single stepped, especially Intel SGX.
        CVE-2020-36177:
            Name: CVE-2020-36177
            Description: RsaPad_PSS in wolfcrypt/src/rsa.c in wolfSSL before 4.6.0
                has an out-of-bounds write for certain relationships between key size
                and digest size.
        CVE-2020-24613:
            Name: CVE-2020-24613
            Description: wolfSSL before 4.5.0 mishandles TLS 1.3 server data in the
                WAIT_CERT_CR state, within SanityCheckTls13MsgReceived() in tls13.c.
                This is an incorrect implementation of the TLS 1.3 client state machine.
                This allows attackers in a privileged network position to completely
                impersonate any TLS 1.3 servers, and read or modify potentially sensitive
                information between clients using the wolfSSL library and these TLS
                servers.
        CVE-2020-24585:
            Name: CVE-2020-24585
            Description: An issue was discovered in the DTLS handshake implementation
                in wolfSSL before 4.5.0. Clear DTLS application_data messages in epoch
                0 do not produce an out-of-order error. Instead, these messages are
                returned to the application.
        CVE-2020-15309:
            Name: CVE-2020-15309
            Description: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0, when single
                precision is not employed. Local attackers can conduct a cache-timing
                attack against public key operations. These attackers may already
                have obtained sensitive information if the affected system has been
                used for private key operations (e.g., signing with a private key).
        CVE-2020-12966:
            Name: CVE-2020-12966
            Description: AMD EPYC&#8482; Processors contain an information disclosure
                vulnerability in the Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Encrypted
                State (SEV-ES) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested
                Paging (SEV-SNP). A local authenticated attacker could potentially
                exploit this vulnerability leading to leaking guest data by the malicious
                hypervisor.
        CVE-2020-12457:
            Name: CVE-2020-12457
            Description: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0. It mishandles
                the change_cipher_spec (CCS) message processing logic for TLS 1.3.
                If an attacker sends ChangeCipherSpec messages in a crafted way involving
                more than one in a row, the server becomes stuck in the ProcessReply()
                loop, i.e., a denial of service.
        CVE-2020-11735:
            Name: CVE-2020-11735
            Description: The private-key operations in ecc.c in wolfSSL before 4.4.0
                do not use a constant-time modular inverse when mapping to affine
                coordinates, aka a "projective coordinates leak."
        CVE-2020-11713:

        CVE-2019-19963:
            Name: CVE-2019-19963
            Description: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.3.0 in a non-default
                configuration where DSA is enabled. DSA signing uses the BEEA algorithm
                during modular inversion of the nonce, leading to a side-channel attack
                against the nonce.
        CVE-2019-19962:
            Name: CVE-2019-19962
            Description: wolfSSL before 4.3.0 mishandles calls to wc_SignatureGenerateHash,
                leading to fault injection in RSA cryptography.
        CVE-2019-19960:
            Name: CVE-2019-19960

        CVE-2019-18840:
            Name: CVE-2019-18840
            Description: In wolfSSL 4.1.0 through 4.2.0c, there are missing sanity
                checks of memory accesses in parsing ASN.1 certificate data while
                handshaking. Specifically, there is a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow
                inside the DecodedCert structure in GetName in wolfcrypt/src/asn.c
                because the domain name location index is mishandled. Because a pointer
                is overwritten, there is an invalid free.
        CVE-2019-16748:
            Name: CVE-2019-16748
            Description: In wolfSSL through 4.1.0, there is a missing sanity check
                of memory accesses in parsing ASN.1 certificate data while handshaking.
                Specifically, there is a one-byte heap-based buffer over-read in CheckCertSignature_ex
                in wolfcrypt/src/asn.c.
        CVE-2019-15651:

            Description: wolfSSL 4.1.0 has a one-byte heap-based buffer over-read
                in DecodeCertExtensions in wolfcrypt/src/asn.c because reading the
                ASN_BOOLEAN byte is mishandled for a crafted DER certificate in GetLength_ex.
        CVE-2019-14317:
            Name: CVE-2019-14317
            Description: wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as
                CyaSSL) generate biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker
                to compute the long term private key from several hundred DSA signatures
                via a lattice attack. The issue occurs because dsa.c fixes two bits
                of the generated nonces.
        CVE-2019-13628:
            Name: CVE-2019-13628
            Description: wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.0.0 and earlier (when configured
                without --enable-fpecc, --enable-sp, or --enable-sp-math) contain
                a timing side channel in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a
                local attacker, able to precisely measure the duration of signature
                operations, to infer information about the nonces used and potentially
                mount a lattice attack to recover the private key used. The issue
                occurs because ecc.c scalar multiplication might leak the bit length.
        CVE-2019-11873:
            Name: CVE-2019-11873
            Description: 'wolfSSL 4.0.0 has a Buffer Overflow in DoPreSharedKeys in
                tls13.c when a current identity size is greater than a client identity
                size. An attacker sends a crafted hello client packet over the network
                to a TLSv1.3 wolfSSL server. The length fields of the packet: record
                length, client hello length, total extensions length, PSK extension
                length, total identity length, and identity length contain their maximum
                value which is 2^16. The identity data field of the PSK extension
                of the packet contains the attack data, to be stored in the undefined
                memory (RAM) of the server. The size of the data is about 65 kB. Possibly
                the attacker can perform a remote code execution attack.'
        CVE-2018-16870:

        CVE-2018-12436:
            Name: CVE-2018-12436
            Description: wolfcrypt/src/ecc.c in wolfSSL before 3.15.1.patch allows
                a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return
                Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the
                attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual
                machine on the same physical host.

            Description: In versions of wolfSSL before 3.10.2 the function fp_mul_comba
                makes it easier to extract RSA key information for a malicious user
                who has access to view cache on a machine.
        CVE-2017-2800:
            Name: CVE-2017-2800
            Description: A specially crafted x509 certificate can cause a single out
                of bounds byte overwrite in wolfSSL through 3.10.2 resulting in potential
                certificate validation vulnerabilities, denial of service and possible
                remote code execution. In order to trigger this vulnerability, the
                attacker needs to supply a malicious x509 certificate to either a
                server or a client application using this library.
        CVE-2017-13099:

            Name: CVE-2023-28725
            Description: General Bytes Crypto Application Server (CAS) 20230120, as
                distributed with General Bytes BATM devices, allows remote attackers
                to execute arbitrary Java code by uploading a Java application to
                the /batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments directory, aka BATM-4780,
                as exploited in the wild in March 2023. This is fixed in 20221118.48

        CVE-2023-25653:
            Name: CVE-2023-25653
            Description: node-jose is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object
                Signing and Encryption (JOSE) for web browsers and node.js-based servers.
                Prior to version 2.2.0, when using the non-default "fallback" crypto
                back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service
                (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an internal calculation.
                For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for
                others, it can be triggered by malicious input. The issue has been
                patched in version 2.2.0. Since this issue is only present in the
                "fallback" crypto implementation, it can be avoided by ensuring that
                either WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module is available in the JS
                environment where `node-jose` is being run.
        CVE-2023-24532:

        CVE-2022-41724:
            Name: CVE-2022-41724
            Description: Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls. Both
                clients and servers may send large TLS handshake records which cause
                servers and clients, respectively, to panic when attempting to construct
                responses. This affects all TLS 1.3 clients, TLS 1.2 clients which
                explicitly enable session resumption (by setting Config.ClientSessionCache
                to a non-nil value), and TLS 1.3 servers which request client certificates
                (by setting Config.ClientAuth >= RequestClientCert).
        CVE-2022-39252:
            Name: CVE-2022-39252
            Description: matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server
                library in Rust, and matrix-sdk-crypto is the Matrix encryption library.
                Prior to version 0.6, when a user requests a room key from their devices,
                the software correctly remembers the request. When the user receives
                a forwarded room key, the software accepts it without checking who
                the room key came from. This allows homeservers to try to insert room
                keys of questionable validity, potentially mounting an impersonation
                attack. Version 0.6 fixes this issue.
        CVE-2022-36083:
            Name: CVE-2022-36083
            Description: 'JOSE is "JSON Web Almost Everything" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT,
                JWK, JWKS with no dependencies using runtime''s native crypto in Node.js,
                Browser, Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based
                JWE key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named
                `p2c` PBES2 Count, which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must
                be executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of
                this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function
                in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more
                expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations
                where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can
                intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will
                initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount
                of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to have
                the user''s environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The
                impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs
                with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who
                do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header
                Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in
                v1.x) decryption option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`,
                `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration
                count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with
                a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If users are
                unable to upgrade their required library version, they have two options
                depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the
                three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms. They can use the
                `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2
                altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the
                decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header
                Parameter).'
        CVE-2022-35255:
            Name: CVE-2022-35255
            Description: 'A weak randomness in WebCrypto keygen vulnerability exists

                in src/crypto/crypto_keygen.cc. There are two problems with this:
                1) It does not check the return value, it assumes EntropySource()
                always succeeds, but it can (and sometimes will) fail. 2) The random
                data returned byEntropySource() may not be cryptographically strong

                will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA1 with
                RSA, which is not considered safe anymore for use in certificate signatures,
                due to the risk of collisions with SHA1. The problem has been patched
                in XWiki version 13.10.6, 14.3.1 and 14.4-rc-1. Since then, the Crypto
                API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA256
                with RSA. Administrators are advised to upgrade their XWiki installation

                attacker to bypass authentication into the administration User Interface.
                This is possible because of SWG incorrectly whitelisting authentication
                bypass methods and using a weak crypto password. This can lead to
                the attacker logging into the SWG admin interface, without valid credentials,
                as the super user with complete control over the SWG.

        CVE-2021-41117:
            Name: CVE-2021-41117
            Description: 'keypair is a a RSA PEM key generator written in javascript.
                keypair implements a lot of cryptographic primitives on its own or
                by borrowing from other libraries where possible, including node-forge.
                An issue was discovered where this library was generating identical
                RSA keys used in SSH. This would mean that the library is generating
                identical P, Q (and thus N) values which, in practical terms, is impossible
                with RSA-2048 keys. Generating identical values, repeatedly, usually
                indicates an issue with poor random number generation, or, poor handling
                of CSPRNG output. Issue 1: Poor random number generation (`GHSL-2021-1012`).
                The library does not rely entirely on a platform provided CSPRNG,
                rather, it uses it''s own counter-based CMAC approach. Where things
                go wrong is seeding the CMAC implementation with "true" random data
                in the function `defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator,
                the library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript
                execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971).
                However, in a nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is
                not defined, so it goes down a much less secure solution, also of
                which has a bug in it. It does look like the library tries to use
                node''s CSPRNG when possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto`
                object is null because a variable was declared with the same name,
                and set to `null`. So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However,
                when `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer
                LCG random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and
                the LCG is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would
                likely qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the
                extreme frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The
                output from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008]
                with the flaw is: `b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The
                [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352)
                of `putByte` is `util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data
                += String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next
                & 0xFF))`. The double `String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional
                and the source of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result
                in an error. Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros.
                Since we are masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output
                from the LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result
                in meaningful values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact
                is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due
                to incorrect conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9.
                In summary, there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has
                an insecure random number fallback path. Ideally the library would
                require a strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`.
                2. The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator
                when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The
                fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority
                of the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor
                random number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively
                easy to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential
                messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the
                victim.'

        CVE-2020-14378:
            Name: CVE-2020-14378
            Description: An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and
                before 19.11.5 in the `move_desc` function can lead to large amounts
                of CPU cycles being eaten up in a long running loop. An attacker could
                cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration
                loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent
                other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore
                for an extended period.
        CVE-2020-14377:
            Name: CVE-2020-14377
            Description: A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and
                before 19.11.5. A complete lack of validation of attacker-controlled
                parameters can lead to a buffer over read. The results of the over
                read are then written back to the guest virtual machine memory. This
                vulnerability can be used by an attacker in a virtual machine to read
                significant amounts of host memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability
                is to data confidentiality and system availability.
        CVE-2020-14376:
            Name: CVE-2020-14376
            Description: A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and
                before 19.11.5. A lack of bounds checking when copying iv_data from
                the VM guest memory into host memory can lead to a large buffer overflow.
                The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
                and integrity as well as system availability.
        CVE-2020-14375:
            Name: CVE-2020-14375
            Description: A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and
                before 19.11.5. Virtio ring descriptors, and the data they describe
                are in a region of memory accessible by from both the virtual machine
                and the host. An attacker in a VM can change the contents of the memory
                after vhost_crypto has validated it. The highest threat from this
                vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as
                system availability.
        CVE-2020-14374:
            Name: CVE-2020-14374
            Description: A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and
                before 19.11.5. A flawed bounds checking in the copy_data function
                leads to a buffer overflow allowing an attacker in a virtual machine
                to write arbitrary data to any address in the vhost_crypto application.
                The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
                and integrity as well as system availability.
        CVE-2020-13398:
            Name: CVE-2020-13398
            Description: An issue was discovered in FreeRDP before 2.1.1. An out-of-bounds
                (OOB) write vulnerability has been detected in crypto_rsa_common in
                libfreerdp/crypto/crypto.c.
        CVE-2020-11810:
            Name: CVE-2020-11810
            Description: An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An
                attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim's
                peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives
                before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the
                victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing
                due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between
                the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response
                back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher
                Parameters (NCP) is in use.
        CVE-2020-10769:
            Name: CVE-2020-10769
            Description: A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before
                5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec
                Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When a payload longer than
                4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines,
                it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This
                flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial
                of service.
        CVE-2020-10724:
            Name: CVE-2020-10724

                built against a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported
                elements, do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit.
                An attacker may be able to use invalid scalar/element values to complete
                authentication, gaining session key and network access without needing
                or learning the password. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant
                with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected.

            Name: CVE-2019-18808
            Description: A memory leak in the ccp_run_sha_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c
                in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial
                of service (memory consumption), aka CID-128c66429247.
        CVE-2019-18222:
            Name: CVE-2019-18222
            Description: The ECDSA signature implementation in ecdsa.c in Arm Mbed
                Crypto 2.1 and Mbed TLS through 2.19.1 does not reduce the blinded
                scalar before computing the inverse, which allows a local attacker
                to recover the private key via side-channel attacks.
        CVE-2019-17359:
            Name: CVE-2019-17359
            Description: The ASN.1 parser in Bouncy Castle Crypto (aka BC Java) 1.63
                can trigger a large attempted memory allocation, and resultant OutOfMemoryError
                error, via crafted ASN.1 data. This is fixed in 1.64.
        CVE-2019-16910:
            Name: CVE-2019-16910
            Description: Arm Mbed TLS before 2.19.0 and Arm Mbed Crypto before 2.0.0,
                when deterministic ECDSA is enabled, use an RNG with insufficient
                entropy for blinding, which might allow an attacker to recover a private
                key via side-channel attacks if a victim signs the same message many
                times. (For Mbed TLS, the fix is also available in versions 2.7.12
                and 2.16.3.)
        CVE-2019-1549:
            Name: CVE-2019-1549
            Description: OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator
                (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork()
                system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes
                did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not
                being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue
                is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG
                state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state
                is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto()
                explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur
                at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
        CVE-2019-15256:
            Name: CVE-2019-15256
            Description: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1)
                feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco
                Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
                remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting
                in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to
                improper management of system memory. An attacker could exploit this
                vulnerability by sending malicious IKEv1 traffic to an affected device.
                The attacker does not need valid credentials to authenticate the VPN
                session, nor does the attacker's source address need to match a peer
                statement in the crypto map applied to the ingress interface of the
                affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system
                memory resources, leading to a reload of an affected device.
        CVE-2019-14318:
            Name: CVE-2019-14318
            Description: Crypto++ 8.3.0 and earlier contains a timing side channel
                in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local or remote attacker,
                able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations,
                to compute the private key used. The issue occurs because scalar multiplication
                in ecp.cpp (prime field curves, small leakage) and algebra.cpp (binary
                field curves, large leakage) is not constant time and leaks the bit
                length of the scalar among other information.
        CVE-2019-13629:
            Name: CVE-2019-13629
            Description: MatrixSSL 4.2.1 and earlier contains a timing side channel
                in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local or a remote attacker,
                able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations,
                to compute the private key used. The issue occurs because crypto/pubkey/ecc_math.c
                scalar multiplication leaks the bit length of the scalar.
        CVE-2019-13179:
            Name: CVE-2019-13179
            Description: Calamares versions 3.1 through 3.2.10 copies a LUKS encryption
                keyfile from /crypto_keyfile.bin (mode 0600 owned by root) to /boot
                within a globally readable initramfs image with insecure permissions,
                which allows this originally protected file to be read by any user,
                thereby disclosing decryption keys for LUKS containers created with
                Full Disk Encryption.
        CVE-2019-11841:
            Name: CVE-2019-11841
            Description: A message-forgery issue was discovered in crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go
                in supplementary Go cryptography libraries 2019-03-25. According to
                the OpenPGP Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a
                cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional "Hash" Armor
                Headers. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s)
                used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores
                the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently,
                an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated
                using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually
                used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general,
                an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend
                arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating the signatures.
        CVE-2019-11840:
            Name: CVE-2019-11840
            Description: An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography
                libraries, aka golang-googlecode-go-crypto, before 2019-03-20. A flaw
                was found in the amd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20
                and golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream
                is generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits,
                the amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and
                then cycle back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream
                bytes can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications,
                or to predictability in CSPRNG applications.
        CVE-2019-10914:
            Name: CVE-2019-10914
            Description: pubRsaDecryptSignedElementExt in MatrixSSL 4.0.1 Open, as
                used in Inside Secure TLS Toolkit, has a stack-based buffer overflow
                during X.509 certificate verification because of missing validation
                in psRsaDecryptPubExt in crypto/pubkey/rsa_pub.c.
        CVE-2019-0112:
            Name: CVE-2019-0112
            Description: Improper flow control in crypto routines for Intel(R) Data
                Center Manager SDK before version 5.0.2 may allow a privileged user
                to potentially enable a denial of service via local access.
        CVE-2018-9233:
            Name: CVE-2018-9233
            Description: Sophos Endpoint Protection 10.7 uses an unsalted SHA-1 hash
                for password storage in %PROGRAMDATA%\Sophos\Sophos Anti-Virus\Config\machine.xml,
                which makes it easier for attackers to determine a cleartext password,
                and subsequently choose unsafe malware settings, via rainbow tables
                or other approaches.
        CVE-2018-6594:
            Name: CVE-2018-6594
            Description: lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1
                generates weak ElGamal key parameters, which allows attackers to obtain
                sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not
                have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional
                Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto's ElGamal
                implementation.

                to user programs. NOTE: this is a CVE-2013-2547 regression but with
                easier exploitability because the attacker does not need a capability
                (however, the system must have the CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER kconfig option).'
        CVE-2018-16875:

        CVE-2017-7374:
            Name: CVE-2017-7374
            Description: Use-after-free vulnerability in fs/crypto/ in the Linux kernel
                before 4.10.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL
                pointer dereference) or possibly gain privileges by revoking keyring
                keys being used for ext4, f2fs, or ubifs encryption, causing cryptographic
                transform objects to be freed prematurely.
        CVE-2017-6615:
            Name: CVE-2017-6615
            Description: 'A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol
                (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS XE 3.16 could allow an authenticated,
                remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
                vulnerability is due to a race condition that could occur when the
                affected software processes an SNMP read request that contains certain
                criteria for a specific object ID (OID) and an active crypto session
                is disconnected on an affected device. An attacker who can authenticate
                to an affected device could trigger this vulnerability by issuing
                an SNMP request for a specific OID on the device. A successful exploit
                will cause the device to restart due to an attempt to access an invalid
                memory region. The attacker does not control how or when crypto sessions
                are disconnected on the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb94392.'

            Description: EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2 has a PKCS#12
                Timing Attack Vulnerability. A possible timing attack could be carried
                out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which

                PKCS#12 file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at
                a time. This is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time
                method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability

                parameter field, which might make it easier for attackers to defeat
                a cryptographic protection mechanism and discover an authentication
                key via a crafted application, aka internal bug 26234568.  NOTE: The
                vendor disputes the existence of this potential issue in Android,
                stating "This CVE was raised in error: it referred to the authentication
                tag size in GCM, whose default according to ASN.1 encoding (12 bytes)
                can lead to vulnerabilities. After careful consideration, it was decided
                that the insecure default value of 12 bytes was a default only for
                the encoding and not default anywhere else in Android, and hence no
                vulnerability existed."'

        CVE-2005-1664:
            Name: CVE-2005-1664
            Description: The __VIEWSTATE functionality in Microsoft ASP.NET 1.x allows
                remote attackers to conduct replay attacks to (1) apply a ViewState
                generated from one view to a different view, (2) reuse ViewState information
                after the application's state has changed, or (3) use the ViewState
                to conduct attacks or expose content to third parties.
        CVE-2005-0968:

        CVE-2004-0004:
            Name: CVE-2004-0004
            Description: The libCheckSignature function in crypto-utils.lib for OpenCA
                0.9.1.6 and earlier only compares the serial of the signer's certificate
                and the one in the database, which can cause OpenCA to incorrectly
                accept a signature if the certificate's chain is trusted by OpenCA's
                chain directory, allowing remote attackers to spoof requests from
                other users.

        CVE-2023-26490:
            Name: CVE-2023-26490
            Description: mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers
                linked in one bridged network. The Sync Job feature - which can be
                made available to standard users by assigning them the necessary permission
                - suffers from a shell command injection. A malicious user can abuse
                this vulnerability to obtain shell access to the Docker container
                running dovecot. The imapsync Perl script implements all the necessary
                functionality for this feature, including the XOAUTH2 authentication
                mechanism. This code path creates a shell command to call openssl.
                However, since different parts of the specified user password are
                included without any validation, one can simply execute additional
                shell commands. Notably, the default ACL for a newly-created mailcow
                account does not include the necessary permission. The Issue has been
                fixed within the 2023-03 Update (March 3rd 2023). As a temporary workaround
                the Syncjob ACL can be removed from all mailbox users, preventing
                from creating or changing existing Syncjobs.
        CVE-2023-23919:
            Name: CVE-2023-23919
            Description: A cryptographic vulnerability exists in Node.js <19.2.0,
                <18.14.1, <16.19.1, <14.21.3 that in some cases did does not clear
                the OpenSSL error stack after operations that may set it. This may
                lead to false positive errors during subsequent cryptographic operations
                that happen to be on the same thread. This in turn could be used to
                cause a denial of service.
        CVE-2023-0466:
            Name: CVE-2023-0466
            Description: The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented
                to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
                verification. However the implementation of the function does not
                enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
                policies to pass the certificate verification. As suddenly enabling
                the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to
                keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()
                function. Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform
                certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()
                or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags()
                with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument. Certificate policy
                checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used
                by applications.
        CVE-2023-0465:
            Name: CVE-2023-0465
            Description: Applications that use a non-default option when verifying
                certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to
                circumvent certain checks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates
                are silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks
                are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to
                deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent
                policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is
                disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument
                to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()'
                function.
        CVE-2023-0464:
            Name: CVE-2023-0464
            Description: A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported
                versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate
                chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit
                this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that
                triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a
                denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing
                is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy'
                argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()'
                function.
        CVE-2023-0401:
            Name: CVE-2023-0401
            Description: A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
                verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
                algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
                the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
                initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
                value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
                usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability
                of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration
                of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.
                PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
                time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
                not call these functions however third party applications would be
                affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
                data.
        CVE-2023-0286:
            Name: CVE-2023-0286
            Description: There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400
                address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were
                parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
                incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE.
                This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp
                as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled
                (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability
                may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call,
                enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service.
                In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the
                certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature.
                If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input
                must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point,
                which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only
                affect applications which have implemented their own functionality
                for retrieving CRLs over a network.
        CVE-2023-0217:
            Name: CVE-2023-0217
            Description: An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when
                an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check()
                function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This
                function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources
                which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack.
                The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but
                applications might call the function if there are additional security
                requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
        CVE-2023-0216:
            Name: CVE-2023-0216
            Description: An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when
                an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i_PKCS7(),
                d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference
                is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack.
                The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however
                third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.
        CVE-2023-0215:
            Name: CVE-2023-0215
            Description: The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function
                used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally
                to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities,
                but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function
                receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO
                onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new
                head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for
                example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO
                is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure.
                However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and
                the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the
                previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop()
                on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely
                result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function
                B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will
                subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is
                in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream,
                PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,
                SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions
                that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS,
                BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL
                cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.
        CVE-2022-4450:
            Name: CVE-2022-4450
            Description: The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO
                and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header
                data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out",
                "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers
                containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for
                freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that
                results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()
                will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with
                a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also
                frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely
                lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the
                ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial
                of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are
                simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions
                are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly
                by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex()
                and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some
                OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because
                the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex()
                returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE()
                functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL
                asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.
        CVE-2022-4304:
            Name: CVE-2022-4304
            Description: 'A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption
                implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across
                a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
                decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large
                number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects
                all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example,
                in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted
                pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine
                connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
                trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process
                them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could
                recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and
                thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.'
        CVE-2022-4203:
            Name: CVE-2022-4203
            Description: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate
                verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that
                this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires
                either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application
                to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct
                a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in
                a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory
                it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents
                (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not
                aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure
                as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this
                can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server,
                this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication
                and a malicious client connects.
        CVE-2022-41141:

            Description: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges
                on affected installations of Windscribe. An attacker must first obtain
                the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in
                order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within
                the configuration of OpenSSL. The product loads an OpenSSL configuration
                file from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
                to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of
                SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-16859.
        CVE-2022-3996:
            Name: CVE-2022-3996
            Description: 'If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint
                and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken
                twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows)
                this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.
                Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not
                considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing
                the `-policy'' argument to the command line utilities or by calling

                a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing
                the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow
                could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client,
                this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS
                server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication
                and a malicious client connects.
        CVE-2022-3602:
            Name: CVE-2022-3602
            Description: A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
                specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
                certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA
                to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
                continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
                to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address
                to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer
                overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or
                potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack
                overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote
                code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout
                for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602
                described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of
                the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded
                to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as
                soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting
                to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the
                server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

        CVE-2022-34900:
            Name: CVE-2022-34900
            Description: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges
                on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.3 (39313) Agent.
                An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged
                code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
                The specific flaw exists within the Dispatcher service. The service
                loads an OpenSSL configuration file from an unsecured location. An
                attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and
                execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-15213.
        CVE-2022-3358:
            Name: CVE-2022-3358
            Description: OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy
                EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This
                function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are
                instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement
                custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle
                legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2()
                and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named
                encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using
                the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent
                cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found
                based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed
                to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible
                for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in
                the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this
                way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will
                match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from
                the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider
                has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that
                offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext
                is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this
                issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently
                use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function.
                Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

        CVE-2022-25219:
            Name: CVE-2022-25219
            Description: A null byte interaction error has been discovered in the
                code that the telnetd_startup daemon uses to construct a pair of ephemeral
                passwords that allow a user to spawn a telnet service on the router,
                and to ensure that the telnet service persists upon reboot. By means
                of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker
                on the local network can leverage this null byte interaction error
                in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with
                1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by
                the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation
                of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher
                (CVE-2022-25218).
        CVE-2022-25218:
            Name: CVE-2022-25218
            Description: The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding
                scheme, in telnetd_startup, allows an unauthenticated attacker on
                the local area network to achieve a significant degree of control
                over the "plaintext" to which an arbitrary blob of ciphertext will
                be decrypted by OpenSSL's RSA_public_decrypt() function. This weakness
                allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd
                startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device,
                by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but
                K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires
                the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).

        CVE-2022-2274:
            Name: CVE-2022-2274

                RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions.
                This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys
                incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during
                the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker
                may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing
                the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA
                private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions
                of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue.
        CVE-2022-21656:
            Name: CVE-2022-21656
            Description: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed
                for cloud-native applications. The default_validator.cc implementation
                used to implement the default certificate validation routines has
                a "type confusion" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing
                allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to
                be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing
                of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL
                implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary
                servers. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should
                not be trusted.
        CVE-2022-2097:
            Name: CVE-2022-2097
            Description: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly
                optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data
                under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data
                that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special
                case of "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would
                be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites
                for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5
                (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).
        CVE-2022-2068:

            Description: In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified
                in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script
                does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command
                injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed
                it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where
                the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to
                a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by
                some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed.
                On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands
                with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered
                obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line
                tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf

        CVE-2022-1473:
            Name: CVE-2022-1473
            Description: The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table,
                contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed
                hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates
                or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates
                or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process
                might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service.
                Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly
                more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients
                or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication.
                The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases
                are not affected by the issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).
        CVE-2022-1434:
            Name: CVE-2022-1434
            Description: 'The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite
                incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key
                trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing
                a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint
                to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still
                pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL
                3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected
                by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many
                application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the
                server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server
                would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both
                endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being
                sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could
                be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in
                the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint
                communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete
                the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of
                data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt
                data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only
                modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately
                negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled
                by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default
                provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never
                be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0
                endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred:
                1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile
                time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy
                provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via
                configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added
                to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been
                set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must
                have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5
                ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in
                common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).'
        CVE-2022-1343:
            Name: CVE-2022-1343
            Description: The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate
                on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS
                is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification)
                even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify.
                It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not
                use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function
                will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case
                of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return
                value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command
                line OpenSSL "ocsp" application. When verifying an ocsp response with
                the "-no_cert_checks" option the command line application will report
                that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed.
                In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied
                by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently
                successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).

                of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and
                should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed
                in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o
                (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).
        CVE-2022-0778:
            Name: CVE-2022-0778
            Description: 'The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square
                root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime
                moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates
                that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit
                elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed
                form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate
                that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing
                happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process
                that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject
                to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached
                when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic
                curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
                consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates
                - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers
                - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers
                - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also
                any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker
                can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue.
                In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial
                parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger
                the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public
                key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular
                the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop
                during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects
                OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases
                of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2
                (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).'
        CVE-2022-0517:
            Name: CVE-2022-0517
            Description: Mozilla VPN can load an OpenSSL configuration file from an
                unsecured directory. A user or attacker with limited privileges could
                leverage this to launch arbitrary code with SYSTEM privilege. This
                vulnerability affects Mozilla VPN < 2.7.1.
        CVE-2021-44273:
            Name: CVE-2021-44273
            Description: e2guardian v5.4.x <= v5.4.3r is affected by missing SSL certificate
                validation in the SSL MITM engine. In standalone mode (i.e., acting
                as a proxy or a transparent proxy), with SSL MITM enabled, e2guardian,
                if built with OpenSSL v1.1.x, did not validate hostnames in certificates
                of the web servers that it connected to, and thus was itself vulnerable
                to MITM attacks.
        CVE-2021-4160:
            Name: CVE-2021-4160
            Description: There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64
                squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some
                of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail,
                because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and
                include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against
                RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to
                perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered
                just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary
                to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline.
                The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
                However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have
                to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer
                an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions
                1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m
                and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is
                addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support
                customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released.
                The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL
                3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l).
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).
        CVE-2021-41079:
            Name: CVE-2021-41079
            Description: Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.63, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.43 and 10.0.0-M1
                to 10.0.2 did not properly validate incoming TLS packets. When Tomcat
                was configured to use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a specially
                crafted packet could be used to trigger an infinite loop resulting
                in a denial of service.
        CVE-2021-4044:
            Name: CVE-2021-4044
            Description: Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on
                the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That
                function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal
                error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is
                mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect()
                or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call
                to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY.
                This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the
                application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback().
                Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY
                return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications
                may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend
                on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops
                or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious
                in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause
                X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a
                certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include
                the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority
                has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid
                chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect,
                application dependent behaviour. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected
                3.0.0).
        CVE-2021-3712:
            Name: CVE-2021-3712
            Description: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as
                an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string
                data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal
                C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which
                is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement,
                ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own "d2i" functions
                (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose
                value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally
                NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However,
                it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING
                structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting
                the "data" and "length" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can
                also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL
                functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the
                ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is
                not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where
                an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
                that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly
                constructed by the application without NUL terminating the "data"
                field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also
                occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example
                if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application
                instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate
                contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur
                in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp()
                functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly
                construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected
                OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result
                in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result
                in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys,
                or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).
        CVE-2021-3711:
            Name: CVE-2021-3711
            Description: In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is
                expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an
                application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry,
                the "out" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the "outlen" parameter
                is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext.
                The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and
                call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value
                for the "out" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption
                code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold
                the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
                be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This
                can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by
                the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious
                attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application
                could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a
                maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after
                the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the
                application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent
                but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected
                1.1.1-1.1.1k).

                in OpenSSL implementation of WAGO 750-831/xxx-xxx, 750-880/xxx-xxx,
                750-881, 750-889 in versions FW4 up to FW15 allows an unauthenticated

        CVE-2021-3450:
            Name: CVE-2021-3450
            Description: The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security
                checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not
                set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow
                certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve
                parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the
                implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check
                to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates
                was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates
                must not be able to issue other certificates. If a "purpose" has been
                configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that
                the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named "purpose" values implemented
                in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set
                the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict
                flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and
                server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden
                or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application
                must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag
                and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or,
                in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default
                purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue.
                Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL
                1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

            Description: An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted
                renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation
                ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was
                present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert
                extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to
                a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable
                if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default
                configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue.

                related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric

                prior to version 21.07.0 was compiled without the no-autoload-config
                option, which allowed an attacker to elevate to the privileges of
                the running process via placing a specially crafted dll in a build
                configuration directory.
        CVE-2021-25698:
            Name: CVE-2021-25698
            Description: The OpenSSL component of the Teradici PCoIP Standard Agent
                prior to version 21.07.0 was compiled without the no-autoload-config
                option, which allowed an attacker to elevate to the privileges of

        CVE-2021-23841:
            Name: CVE-2021-23841
            Description: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()
                attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial
                number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails
                to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer
                field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed).
                This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading
                to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()
                is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only
                vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates
                that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions
                1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions
                should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below
                are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support
                and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers
                of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade
                to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).
        CVE-2021-23840:
            Name: CVE-2021-23840
            Description: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate
                may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input
                length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on
                the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call
                will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be
                negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
                OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users
                of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions
                1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2
                is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium
                support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other
                users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected
                1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).
        CVE-2021-23839:
            Name: CVE-2021-23839
            Description: 'OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate
                SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more
                recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback
                attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or
                TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form
                of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed
                to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form
                of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback
                has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2,
                and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation
                of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt
                is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent.
                This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version
                rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously
                reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made.
                Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected
                by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have
                configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default),
                2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default),
                3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default
                ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore
                is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation
                of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the
                RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although
                1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function
                still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications
                that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter
                this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol
                in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that
                version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public
                updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade
                to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL
                1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).'
        CVE-2021-22901:
            Name: CVE-2021-22901
            Description: curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free
                vulnerability resulting in already freed memory being used when a
                TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server
                can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach
                remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets
                up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL,
                it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval
                when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple
                transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2
                connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new
                session is established on that connection and then the function will
                access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory,
                libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it
                possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage
                to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory.

        CVE-2020-7224:
            Name: CVE-2020-7224
            Description: The Aviatrix OpenVPN client through 2.5.7 on Linux, macOS,
                and Windows is vulnerable when OpenSSL parameters are altered from
                the issued value set; the parameters could allow unauthorized third-party

        CVE-2020-7069:
            Name: CVE-2020-7069
            Description: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and
                7.4.x below 7.4.11, when AES-CCM mode is used with openssl_encrypt()
                function with 12 bytes IV, only first 7 bytes of the IV is actually
                used. This can lead to both decreased security and incorrect encryption

        CVE-2020-36169:
            Name: CVE-2020-36169
            Description: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup through 8.3.0.1
                and OpsCenter through 8.3.0.1. Processes using OpenSSL attempt to
                load and execute libraries from paths that do not exist by default
                on the Windows operating system. By default, on Windows systems, users
                can create directories under the top level of any drive. If a low
                privileged user creates an affected path with a library that the Veritas
                product attempts to load, they can execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM
                or Administrator. This gives the attacker administrator access on
                the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data,
                access all installed applications, etc. This vulnerability affects
                master servers, media servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers on the
                Windows platform. The system is vulnerable during an install or upgrade
                and post-install during normal operations.
        CVE-2020-36168:
            Name: CVE-2020-36168
            Description: An issue was discovered in Veritas Resiliency Platform 3.4
                and 3.5. It leverages OpenSSL on Windows systems when using the Managed
                Host addon. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library. This library
                may attempt to load the openssl.cnf configuration file, which does
                not exist. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories
                under C:\. A low privileged user can create a C:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
                configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in
                arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives
                the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker
                (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications,
                etc.
        CVE-2020-36167:
            Name: CVE-2020-36167
            Description: An issue was discovered in the server in Veritas Backup Exec
                through 16.2, 20.6 before hotfix 298543, and 21.1 before hotfix 657517.
                On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from the Installation folder.
                This library in turn attempts to load the /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf
                configuration file, which may not exist. On Windows systems, this
                path could translate to <drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf. A low
                privileged user can create a :\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration
                file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code
                execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker
                administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default)
                to access all data, access all installed applications, etc. If the
                system is also an Active Directory domain controller, then this can
                affect the entire domain.

                it loads the OpenSSL library from \usr\local\ssl. This library attempts
                to load the \usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file, which may
                not exist. On Windows systems, this path could translate to <drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf,
                where <drive> could be the default Windows installation drive such
                as C:\ or the drive where a Veritas product is installed. By default,
                on Windows systems, users can create directories under any top-level

                as SYSTEM. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system,
                allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all
                installed applications, etc.
        CVE-2020-36160:
            Name: CVE-2020-36160
            Description: An issue was discovered in Veritas System Recovery before
                21.2. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from \usr\local\ssl.
                This library attempts to load the from \usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
                configuration file, which does not exist. By default, on Windows systems,
                users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can
                create a C:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a
                malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as
                SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator
                access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access
                all data and installed applications, etc. If the system is also an
                Active Directory domain controller, then this can affect the entire
                domain.
        CVE-2020-28018:

            Description: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Use After Free in smtp_reset
                in certain situations that may be common for builds with OpenSSL.
        CVE-2020-26050:
            Name: CVE-2020-26050
            Description: SaferVPN for Windows Ver 5.0.3.3 through 5.0.4.15 could allow
                local privilege escalation from low privileged users to SYSTEM via
                a crafted openssl configuration file. This issue is similar to CVE-2019-12572.
        CVE-2020-25646:
            Name: CVE-2020-25646
            Description: A flaw was found in Ansible Collection community.crypto.
                openssl_privatekey_info exposes private key in logs. This directly
                impacts confidentiality
        CVE-2020-25644:
            Name: CVE-2020-25644
            Description: A memory leak flaw was found in WildFly OpenSSL in versions
                prior to 1.1.3.Final, where it removes an HTTP session. It may allow
                the attacker to cause OOM leading to a denial of service. The highest
                threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
        CVE-2020-24714:
            Name: CVE-2020-24714
            Description: The Scalyr Agent before 2.1.10 has Missing SSL Certificate
                Validation because, in some circumstances, the openssl binary is called
                without the -verify_hostname option.
        CVE-2020-1971:
            Name: CVE-2020-1971
            Description: 'The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing
                different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName.
                OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different
                instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This
                function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME.
                A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible
                denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp
                function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
                between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in
                an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token
                signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions
                TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can
                control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger
                a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server
                into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then
                this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download
                CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens
                prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified.
                OpenSSL''s s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the
                "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading
                and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools.
                Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL
                cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However
                it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL''s
                parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1
                and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases
                are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i
                (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).'
        CVE-2020-1968:
            Name: CVE-2020-1968
            Description: The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification
                which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master
                secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based
                ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being
                able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS
                connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation
                re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this
                issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This
                issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer
                receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this
                issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).
        CVE-2020-1967:
            Name: CVE-2020-1967
            Description: Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain()
                function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL
                pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the "signature_algorithms_cert"
                TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature
                algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a
                malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d,
                1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not
                affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected
                1.1.1d-1.1.1f).
        CVE-2020-13962:

                Mumble 1.3.0 and other products, mishandles OpenSSL's error queue,
                which can cause a denial of service to QSslSocket users. Because errors
                leak in unrelated TLS sessions, an unrelated session may be disconnected
                when any handshake fails. (Mumble 1.3.1 is not affected, regardless
                of the Qt version.)
        CVE-2020-13417:

        CVE-2019-19269:
            Name: CVE-2019-19269
            Description: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through
                1.3.6b. A dereference of a NULL pointer may occur. This pointer is
                returned by the OpenSSL sk_X509_REVOKED_value() function when encountering
                an empty CRL installed by a system administrator. The dereference
                occurs when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the
                server in a TLS client/server mutual-authentication setup.
        CVE-2019-17185:
            Name: CVE-2019-17185
            Description: In FreeRADIUS 3.0.x before 3.0.20, the EAP-pwd module used
                a global OpenSSL BN_CTX instance to handle all handshakes. This mean
                multiple threads use the same BN_CTX instance concurrently, resulting
                in crashes when concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes are initiated. This
                can be abused by an adversary as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
        CVE-2019-1563:
            Name: CVE-2019-1563
            Description: In situations where an attacker receives automated notification
                of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after
                sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover
                a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted
                message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher
                padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a
                certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or
                PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL
                1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected
                1.0.2-1.0.2s).
        CVE-2019-1559:
            Name: CVE-2019-1559
            Description: If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then
                calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once
                to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling
                application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared
                to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application
                then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable
                to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could
                be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched"
                ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations
                of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call
                SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications
                should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected
                1.0.2-1.0.2q).
        CVE-2019-1552:
            Name: CVE-2019-1552
            Description: OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where
                it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for
                verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as
                OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration
                options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration
                targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
                in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation
                as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs
                are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories
                of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted
                users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates,
                modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL
                1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix
                and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build
                instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you
                to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2
                are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments
                this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating
                new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL
                1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
        CVE-2019-1551:
            Name: CVE-2019-1551
            Description: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring
                procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms
                are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024,
                3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very
                difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against
                DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target
                would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended
                anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp
                may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e
                (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).
        CVE-2019-1549:
            Name: CVE-2019-1549
            Description: OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator
                (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork()
                system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes
                did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not
                being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue
                is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG
                state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state
                is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto()
                explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur
                at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).

                and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in
                some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters
                (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that
                such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even
                where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve
                is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code
                paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature
                operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have
                the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where
                explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application
                using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable
                because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d
                (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
        CVE-2019-1543:
            Name: CVE-2019-1543
            Description: ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique
                nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that
                the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows
                a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it
                is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce
                to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are
                significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a
                requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages
                encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality
                and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce
                length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading
                bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce
                then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with
                a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are
                not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application
                that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long
                nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher,
                including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long
                nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly
                and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may
                be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this
                issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been
                assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases
                at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b). Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.0k (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0j).
        CVE-2019-14887:
            Name: CVE-2019-14887
            Description: A flaw was found when an OpenSSL security provider is used
                with Wildfly, the 'enabled-protocols' value in the Wildfly configuration
                isn't honored. An attacker could target the traffic sent from Wildfly
                and downgrade the connection to a weaker version of TLS, potentially
                breaking the encryption. This could lead to a leak of the data being
                passed over the network. Wildfly version 7.2.0.GA, 7.2.3.GA and 7.2.5.CR2
                are believed to be vulnerable.
        CVE-2019-12572:
            Name: CVE-2019-12572
            Description: A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet
                Access (PIA) VPN Client 1.0.2 (build 02363) for Windows could allow
                an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated
                privileges. On startup, the PIA Windows service (pia-service.exe)
                loads the OpenSSL library from %PROGRAMFILES%\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll.
                This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration
                file which does not exist. By default on Windows systems, authenticated
                users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can
                create a C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious
                OpenSSL engine library resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM
                when the service starts.
        CVE-2019-10211:
            Name: CVE-2019-10211
            Description: Postgresql Windows installer before versions 11.5, 10.10,
                9.6.15, 9.5.19, 9.4.24 is vulnerable via bundled OpenSSL executing
                code from unprotected directory.
        CVE-2019-0223:
            Name: CVE-2019-0223
            Description: While investigating bug PROTON-2014, we discovered that under
                some circumstances Apache Qpid Proton versions 0.9 to 0.27.0 (C library
                and its language bindings) can connect to a peer anonymously using
                TLS *even when configured to verify the peer certificate* while used
                with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0. This means that an undetected
                man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker can arrange
                to intercept TLS traffic.
        CVE-2019-0190:
            Name: CVE-2019-0190
            Description: A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations.
                A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would
                cause mod_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This
                bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when
                using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes
                to handling of renegotiation attempts.
        CVE-2018-5407:
            Name: CVE-2018-5407
            Description: Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) in processors can enable
                local users to exploit software vulnerable to timing attacks via a
                side-channel timing attack on 'port contention'.
        CVE-2018-20997:
            Name: CVE-2018-20997
            Description: An issue was discovered in the openssl crate before 0.10.9
                for Rust. A use-after-free occurs in CMS Signing.
        CVE-2018-16395:
            Name: CVE-2018-16395
            Description: An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby before
                2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3.
                When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending
                on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first
                argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument
                contains a character that is one less than a character in the same
                position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This
                could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may
                be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.
        CVE-2018-0739:
            Name: CVE-2018-0739
            Description: Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such
                as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given
                malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial
                Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS
                that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o
                (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).
        CVE-2018-0737:
            Name: CVE-2018-0737
            Description: The OpenSSL RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to
                be vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with
                sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key
                generation process could recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL
                1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected
                1.0.2b-1.0.2o).
        CVE-2018-0735:
            Name: CVE-2018-0735
            Description: The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be
                vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use
                variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1a
                (Affected 1.1.1).
        CVE-2018-0734:
            Name: CVE-2018-0734
            Description: The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm has been shown to be
                vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use
                variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.1a (Affected 1.1.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected
                1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2q (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2p).
        CVE-2018-0733:
            Name: CVE-2018-0733
            Description: Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp
                function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant
                bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would
                be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that
                guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only
                be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets
                are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g).
        CVE-2018-0732:
            Name: CVE-2018-0732
            Description: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based
                ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to
                the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long
                period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang
                until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial
                Of Service attack. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h).
                Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2o).
        CVE-2017-8821:
            Name: CVE-2017-8821
            Description: In Tor before 0.2.5.16, 0.2.6 through 0.2.8 before 0.2.8.17,
                0.2.9 before 0.2.9.14, 0.3.0 before 0.3.0.13, and 0.3.1 before 0.3.1.9,
                an attacker can cause a denial of service (application hang) via crafted
                PEM input that signifies a public key requiring a password, which
                triggers an attempt by the OpenSSL library to ask the user for the
                password, aka TROVE-2017-011.
        CVE-2017-5681:
            Name: CVE-2017-5681
            Description: The RSA-CRT implementation in the Intel QuickAssist Technology
                (QAT) Engine for OpenSSL versions prior to 0.5.19 may allow remote
                attackers to obtain private RSA keys by conducting a Lenstra side-channel
                attack.
        CVE-2017-3738:
            Name: CVE-2017-3738
            Description: 'There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication
                procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms
                are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as
                a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are
                not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible,
                because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private
                key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for
                such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS
                to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private
                key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
                This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions
                like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue
                is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL
                version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL
                1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a
                new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included
                in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available
                in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.'
        CVE-2017-3737:
            Name: CVE-2017-3737
            Description: OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an
                "error state" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred
                during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and
                would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake.
                This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(),
                SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not
                work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In
                that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned
                in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently
                called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed
                and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly
                from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application
                bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write()
                being issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL
                version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL
                1.1.0 is not affected.
        CVE-2017-3736:
            Name: CVE-2017-3736

                squaring procedure in OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0g.
                No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against
                RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to

                The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very
                significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers.
                An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched
                system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent
                DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients.

                extension is negotiated where it was not in the original handshake
                (or vice-versa) then this can cause OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0e to
                crash (dependent on ciphersuite). Both clients and servers are affected.

                disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.
        CVE-2017-3730:
            Name: CVE-2017-3730
            Description: In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d, if a malicious server supplies
                bad parameters for a DHE or ECDHE key exchange then this can result
                in the client attempting to dereference a NULL pointer leading to
                a client crash. This could be exploited in a Denial of Service attack.
        CVE-2017-16064:
            Name: CVE-2017-16064
            Description: node-openssl was a malicious module published with the intent
                to hijack environment variables. It has been unpublished by npm.
        CVE-2017-15896:
            Name: CVE-2017-15896
            Description: Node.js was affected by OpenSSL vulnerability CVE-2017-3737
                in regards to the use of SSL_read() due to TLS handshake failure.
                The result was that an active network attacker could send application
                data to Node.js using the TLS or HTTP2 modules in a way that bypassed
                TLS authentication and encryption.
        CVE-2017-14033:
            Name: CVE-2017-14033
            Description: The decode method in the OpenSSL::ASN1 module in Ruby before
                2.2.8, 2.3.x before 2.3.5, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 allows attackers
                to cause a denial of service (interpreter crash) via a crafted string.
        CVE-2017-11144:
            Name: CVE-2017-11144
            Description: In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before
                7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return
                value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash
                of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for
                a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation
                omission.
        CVE-2016-9015:
            Name: CVE-2016-9015
            Description: Versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the Python urllib3 library suffer
                from a vulnerability that can cause them, in certain configurations,
                to not correctly validate TLS certificates. This places users of the
                library with those configurations at risk of man-in-the-middle and
                information leakage attacks. This vulnerability affects users using
                versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the urllib3 library, who are using the optional
                PyOpenSSL support for TLS instead of the regular standard library
                TLS backend, and who are using OpenSSL 1.1.0 via PyOpenSSL. This is
                an extremely uncommon configuration, so the security impact of this
                vulnerability is low.
        CVE-2016-8610:
            Name: CVE-2016-8610
            Description: A denial of service flaw was found in OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.1,
                1.0.2 through 1.0.2h, and 1.1.0 in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined
                processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote
                attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive
                amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients.
        CVE-2016-7798:
            Name: CVE-2016-7798
            Description: The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector
                (IV) in GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which
                makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption
                protection mechanism.
        CVE-2016-7056:
            Name: CVE-2016-7056
            Description: A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL 1.0.1u and before
                that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA
                P-256 private keys.
        CVE-2016-7055:
            Name: CVE-2016-7055
            Description: There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific
                Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before
                1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256
                bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private
                keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is
                not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of
                the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself
                as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible
                erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted
                input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected
                and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not
                analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered
                unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question
                and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of
                which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the
                curve will be affected.
        CVE-2016-7054:
            Name: CVE-2016-7054
            Description: In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305
                ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger
                payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered
                to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
        CVE-2016-7053:
            Name: CVE-2016-7053
            Description: In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, applications parsing invalid
                CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is
                caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL
                1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure
                callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings.
                Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value
                are affected.
        CVE-2016-7052:
            Name: CVE-2016-7052
            Description: crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2i allows remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
                crash) by triggering a CRL operation.
        CVE-2016-6309:
            Name: CVE-2016-6309
            Description: statem/statem.c in OpenSSL 1.1.0a does not consider memory-block
                movement after a realloc call, which allows remote attackers to cause
                a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly execute arbitrary
                code via a crafted TLS session.
        CVE-2016-6308:
            Name: CVE-2016-6308
            Description: statem/statem_dtls.c in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL
                1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allocates memory before checking for an excessive
                length, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (memory consumption) via crafted DTLS messages.
        CVE-2016-6307:
            Name: CVE-2016-6307
            Description: The state-machine implementation in OpenSSL 1.1.0 before
                1.1.0a allocates memory before checking for an excessive length, which
                might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
                consumption) via crafted TLS messages, related to statem/statem.c
                and statem/statem_lib.c.
        CVE-2016-6306:
            Name: CVE-2016-6306
            Description: The certificate parser in OpenSSL before 1.0.1u and 1.0.2
                before 1.0.2i might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (out-of-bounds read) via crafted certificate operations, related to
                s3_clnt.c and s3_srvr.c.
        CVE-2016-6305:
            Name: CVE-2016-6305
            Description: The ssl3_read_bytes function in record/rec_layer_s3.c in
                OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allows remote attackers to cause a denial
                of service (infinite loop) by triggering a zero-length record in an
                SSL_peek call.
        CVE-2016-6304:
            Name: CVE-2016-6304
            Description: Multiple memory leaks in t1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.0.1u,
                1.0.2 before 1.0.2i, and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allow remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via large OCSP Status
                Request extensions.
        CVE-2016-6303:
            Name: CVE-2016-6303
            Description: Integer overflow in the MDC2_Update function in crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c
                in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
                of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash) or possibly
                have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
        CVE-2016-6302:
            Name: CVE-2016-6302
            Description: The tls_decrypt_ticket function in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL
                before 1.1.0 does not consider the HMAC size during validation of
                the ticket length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
                of service via a ticket that is too short.
        CVE-2016-5669:
            Name: CVE-2016-5669
            Description: Crestron Electronics DM-TXRX-100-STR devices with firmware
                before 1.3039.00040 use a hardcoded 0xb9eed4d955a59eb3 X.509 certificate
                from an OpenSSL Test Certification Authority, which makes it easier
                for remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against
                HTTPS sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship.
        CVE-2016-3613:
            Name: CVE-2016-3613
            Description: Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Secure Global Desktop
                component in Oracle Virtualization 4.63, 4.71, and 5.2 allows remote
                attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
                vectors related to OpenSSL.

                certificate verification is off by default and there is no API for
                hostname verification.
        CVE-2016-0800:
            Name: CVE-2016-0800
            Description: The SSLv2 protocol, as used in OpenSSL before 1.0.1s and
                1.0.2 before 1.0.2g and other products, requires a server to send
                a ServerVerify message before establishing that a client possesses
                certain plaintext RSA data, which makes it easier for remote attackers
                to decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA
                padding oracle, aka a "DROWN" attack.
        CVE-2016-0799:
            Name: CVE-2016-0799
            Description: The fmtstr function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1
                before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g improperly calculates string
                lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other
                impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1
                data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-2842.
        CVE-2016-0798:
            Name: CVE-2016-0798
            Description: Memory leak in the SRP_VBASE_get_by_user implementation in
                OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g allows remote
                attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by providing
                an invalid username in a connection attempt, related to apps/s_server.c
                and crypto/srp/srp_vfy.c.
        CVE-2016-0797:
            Name: CVE-2016-0797
            Description: Multiple integer overflows in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s
                and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
                service (heap memory corruption or NULL pointer dereference) or possibly
                have unspecified other impact via a long digit string that is mishandled
                by the (1) BN_dec2bn or (2) BN_hex2bn function, related to crypto/bn/bn.h
                and crypto/bn/bn_print.c.
        CVE-2016-0705:
            Name: CVE-2016-0705
            Description: Double free vulnerability in the dsa_priv_decode function
                in crypto/dsa/dsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2
                before 1.0.2g allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
                a malformed DSA private key.
        CVE-2016-0704:
            Name: CVE-2016-0704
            Description: An oracle protection mechanism in the get_client_master_key
                function in s2_srvr.c in the SSLv2 implementation in OpenSSL before
                0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before
                1.0.2a overwrites incorrect MASTER-KEY bytes during use of export
                cipher suites, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt
                TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle,
                a related issue to CVE-2016-0800.
        CVE-2016-0703:
            Name: CVE-2016-0703
            Description: The get_client_master_key function in s2_srvr.c in the SSLv2
                implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1
                before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a accepts a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
                CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher, which allows man-in-the-middle
                attackers to determine the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext
                data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, a related
                issue to CVE-2016-0800.
        CVE-2016-0702:
            Name: CVE-2016-0702
            Description: The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c
                in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly
                consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which
                makes it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a
                crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim
                and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a "CacheBleed" attack.
        CVE-2016-0701:
            Name: CVE-2016-0701
            Description: The DH_check_pub_key function in crypto/dh/dh_check.c in
                OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2f does not ensure that prime numbers are
                appropriate for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, which makes it easier
                for remote attackers to discover a private DH exponent by making multiple
                handshakes with a peer that chose an inappropriate number, as demonstrated
                by a number in an X9.42 file.
        CVE-2015-8867:
            Name: CVE-2015-8867
            Description: The openssl_random_pseudo_bytes function in ext/openssl/openssl.c
                in PHP before 5.4.44, 5.5.x before 5.5.28, and 5.6.x before 5.6.12
                incorrectly relies on the deprecated RAND_pseudo_bytes function, which
                makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection
                mechanisms via unspecified vectors.
        CVE-2015-3276:
            Name: CVE-2015-3276
            Description: The nss_parse_ciphers function in libraries/libldap/tls_m.c
                in OpenLDAP does not properly parse OpenSSL-style multi-keyword mode
                cipher strings, which might cause a weaker than intended cipher to
                be used and allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via
                unknown vectors.
        CVE-2015-3216:
            Name: CVE-2015-3216
            Description: Race condition in a certain Red Hat patch to the PRNG lock
                implementation in the ssleay_rand_bytes function in OpenSSL, as distributed
                in openssl-1.0.1e-25.el7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and
                other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (application crash) by establishing many TLS sessions to a multithreaded
                server, leading to use of a negative value for a certain length field.
        CVE-2015-3197:
            Name: CVE-2015-3197
            Description: ssl/s2_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1r and 1.0.2 before
                1.0.2f does not prevent use of disabled ciphers, which makes it easier
                for man-in-the-middle attackers to defeat cryptographic protection
                mechanisms by performing computations on SSLv2 traffic, related to
                the get_client_master_key and get_client_hello functions.
        CVE-2015-3196:
            Name: CVE-2015-3196
            Description: ssl/s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before 1.0.0t, 1.0.1 before
                1.0.1p, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2d, when used for a multi-threaded client,
                writes the PSK identity hint to an incorrect data structure, which
                allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (race condition
                and double free) via a crafted ServerKeyExchange message.
        CVE-2015-3195:
            Name: CVE-2015-3195
            Description: The ASN1_TFLG_COMBINE implementation in crypto/asn1/tasn_dec.c
                in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zh, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0t, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1q,
                and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e mishandles errors caused by malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE
                data, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
                from process memory by triggering a decoding failure in a PKCS#7 or
                CMS application.
        CVE-2015-3194:
            Name: CVE-2015-3194
            Description: crypto/rsa/rsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1q and
                1.0.2 before 1.0.2e allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an RSA PSS ASN.1
                signature that lacks a mask generation function parameter.
        CVE-2015-3193:
            Name: CVE-2015-3193
            Description: The Montgomery squaring implementation in crypto/bn/asm/x86_64-mont5.pl
                in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e on the x86_64 platform, as used by
                the BN_mod_exp function, mishandles carry propagation and produces
                incorrect output, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
                sensitive private-key information via an attack against use of a (1)
                Diffie-Hellman (DH) or (2) Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) ciphersuite.
        CVE-2015-2264:

                been disputed by the Ruby OpenSSL team and third parties, who state
                that the original demonstration PoC contains errors and redundant
                or unnecessarily-complex code that does not appear to be related to
                a demonstration of the issue. As of 20140502, CVE is not aware of
                any public comment by the original researcher.'
        CVE-2014-2234:
            Name: CVE-2014-2234
            Description: A certain Apple patch for OpenSSL in Apple OS X 10.9.2 and
                earlier uses a Trust Evaluation Agent (TEA) feature without terminating
                certain TLS/SSL handshakes as specified in the SSL_CTX_set_verify
                callback function's documentation, which allows remote attackers to
                bypass extra verification within a custom application via a crafted
                certificate chain that is acceptable to TEA but not acceptable to
                that application.
        CVE-2014-0224:
            Name: CVE-2014-0224
            Description: OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before
                1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,
                which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length
                master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently
                hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS
                handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.
        CVE-2014-0221:
            Name: CVE-2014-0221
            Description: The dtls1_get_message_fragment function in d1_both.c in OpenSSL
                before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h allows
                remote attackers to cause a denial of service (recursion and client
                crash) via a DTLS hello message in an invalid DTLS handshake.
        CVE-2014-0198:
            Name: CVE-2014-0198
            Description: The do_ssl3_write function in s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.x through
                1.0.1g, when SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, does not properly
                manage a buffer pointer during certain recursive calls, which allows
                remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
                and application crash) via vectors that trigger an alert condition.
        CVE-2014-0195:
            Name: CVE-2014-0195
            Description: The dtls1_reassemble_fragment function in d1_both.c in OpenSSL
                before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does
                not properly validate fragment lengths in DTLS ClientHello messages,
                which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
                denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via a long
                non-initial fragment.
        CVE-2014-0160:
            Name: CVE-2014-0160
            Description: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1
                before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets,
                which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from
                process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read,
                as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1_both.c and
                t1_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.
        CVE-2014-0139:
            Name: CVE-2014-0139
            Description: cURL and libcurl 7.1 before 7.36.0, when using the OpenSSL,
                axtls, qsossl or gskit libraries for TLS, recognize a wildcard IP
                address in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate,
                which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL
                servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
                Authority.
        CVE-2014-0076:
            Name: CVE-2014-0076
            Description: The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL through 1.0.0l
                does not ensure that certain swap operations have a constant-time
                behavior, which makes it easier for local users to obtain ECDSA nonces
                via a FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack.
        CVE-2014-0017:
            Name: CVE-2014-0017
            Description: The RAND_bytes function in libssh before 0.6.3, when forking
                is enabled, does not properly reset the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random
                number generator (PRNG), which causes the state to be shared between
                children processes and allows local users to obtain sensitive information
                by leveraging a pid collision.
        CVE-2014-0016:
            Name: CVE-2014-0016
            Description: stunnel before 5.00, when using fork threading, does not
                properly update the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator
                (PRNG), which causes subsequent children with the same process ID
                to use the same entropy pool and allows remote attackers to obtain
                private keys for EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates.
        CVE-2013-7373:
            Name: CVE-2013-7373
            Description: Android before 4.4 does not properly arrange for seeding
                of the OpenSSL PRNG, which makes it easier for attackers to defeat
                cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging use of the PRNG
                within multiple applications.
        CVE-2013-7295:
            Name: CVE-2013-7295
            Description: Tor before 0.2.4.20, when OpenSSL 1.x is used in conjunction
                with a certain HardwareAccel setting on Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy
                Bridge platforms, does not properly generate random numbers for (1)
                relay identity keys and (2) hidden-service identity keys, which might
                make it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection
                mechanisms via unspecified vectors.
        CVE-2013-6450:
            Name: CVE-2013-6450
            Description: The DTLS retransmission implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before
                1.0.0l and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1f does not properly maintain data structures
                for digest and encryption contexts, which might allow man-in-the-middle
                attackers to trigger the use of a different context and cause a denial
                of service (application crash) by interfering with packet delivery,
                related to ssl/d1_both.c and ssl/t1_enc.c.
        CVE-2013-6449:
            Name: CVE-2013-6449
            Description: The ssl_get_algorithm2 function in ssl/s3_lib.c in OpenSSL
                before 1.0.2 obtains a certain version number from an incorrect data
                structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (daemon crash) via crafted traffic from a TLS 1.2 client.
        CVE-2013-6420:
            Name: CVE-2013-6420
            Description: The asn1_time_to_time_t function in ext/openssl/openssl.c
                in PHP before 5.3.28, 5.4.x before 5.4.23, and 5.5.x before 5.5.7
                does not properly parse (1) notBefore and (2) notAfter timestamps
                in X.509 certificates, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
                code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted
                certificate that is not properly handled by the openssl_x509_parse
                function.
        CVE-2013-4548:
            Name: CVE-2013-4548
            Description: The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c in sshd
                in OpenSSH 6.2 and 6.3, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly
                initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote
                authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell
                restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address.
        CVE-2013-4545:
            Name: CVE-2013-4545
            Description: cURL and libcurl 7.18.0 through 7.32.0, when built with OpenSSL,
                disables the certificate CN and SAN name field verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST)
                when the digital signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER) is
                disabled, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers
                via an arbitrary valid certificate.
        CVE-2013-4508:
            Name: CVE-2013-4508
            Description: lighttpd before 1.4.34, when SNI is enabled, configures weak
                SSL ciphers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack
                sessions by inserting packets into the client-server data stream or
                obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.

            Name: CVE-2013-4425
            Description: The DICOM listener in OsiriX before 5.8 and before 2.5-MD,
                when starting up, encrypts the TLS private key file using "SuperSecretPassword"
                as the hardcoded password, which allows local users to obtain the
                private key.
        CVE-2013-4353:
            Name: CVE-2013-4353
            Description: The ssl3_take_mac function in ssl/s3_both.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1
                before 1.0.1f allows remote TLS servers to cause a denial of service
                (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted Next
                Protocol Negotiation record in a TLS handshake.
        CVE-2013-4248:

                not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement
                during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote
                attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
                attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets,
                aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.
        CVE-2013-0166:

                before 4.7.6, 4.8.x before 4.8.5, when using certain versions of openSSL,
                uses an "incompatible structure layout" that can read memory from
                the wrong location, which causes Qt to report an incorrect error when
                certificate validation fails and might cause users to make unsafe
                security decisions to accept a certificate.
        CVE-2012-4930:

                support is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (assertion failure) via an X.509 certificate containing certificate-extension
                data associated with (1) IP address blocks or (2) Autonomous System
                (AS) identifiers.
        CVE-2011-4576:
            Name: CVE-2011-4576
            Description: The SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x
                before 1.0.0f does not properly initialize data structures for block
                cipher padding, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
                information by decrypting the padding data sent by an SSL peer.
        CVE-2011-4354:
            Name: CVE-2011-4354
            Description: crypto/bn/bn_nist.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8h on 32-bit platforms,
                as used in stunnel and other products, in certain circumstances involving
                ECDH or ECDHE cipher suites, uses an incorrect modular reduction algorithm
                in its implementation of the P-256 and P-384 NIST elliptic curves,
                which allows remote attackers to obtain the private key of a TLS server
                via multiple handshake attempts.
        CVE-2011-4302:
            Name: CVE-2011-4302
            Description: mnet/xmlrpc/client.php in MNET in Moodle 1.9.x before 1.9.14,
                2.0.x before 2.0.5, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2 does not properly process
                the return value of the openssl_verify function, which allows remote
                attackers to bypass validation via a crafted certificate.
        CVE-2011-4121:
            Name: CVE-2011-4121
            Description: The OpenSSL extension of Ruby (Git trunk) versions after
                2011-09-01 up to 2011-11-03 always generated an exponent value of
                '1' to be used for private RSA key generation. A remote attacker could
                use this flaw to bypass or corrupt integrity of services, depending
                on strong private RSA keys generation mechanism.
        CVE-2011-4109:
            Name: CVE-2011-4109
            Description: Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8s,
                when X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is enabled, allows remote attackers
                to have an unspecified impact by triggering failure of a policy check.
        CVE-2011-4108:
            Name: CVE-2011-4108
            Description: The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x
                before 1.0.0f performs a MAC check only if certain padding is valid,
                which makes it easier for remote attackers to recover plaintext via
                a padding oracle attack.
        CVE-2011-3210:
            Name: CVE-2011-3210
            Description: The ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite functionality in OpenSSL 0.9.8
                through 0.9.8r and 1.0.x before 1.0.0e does not ensure thread safety
                during processing of handshake messages from clients, which allows
                remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via out-of-order
                messages that violate the TLS protocol.
        CVE-2011-3207:
            Name: CVE-2011-3207
            Description: crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.x before 1.0.0e does
                not initialize certain structure members, which makes it easier for
                remote attackers to bypass CRL validation by using a nextUpdate value
                corresponding to a time in the past.
        CVE-2011-1945:
            Name: CVE-2011-1945
            Description: The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) subsystem in OpenSSL
                1.0.0d and earlier, when the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
                (ECDSA) is used for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, does not properly
                implement curves over binary fields, which makes it easier for context-dependent
                attackers to determine private keys via a timing attack and a lattice
                calculation.
        CVE-2011-1473:
            Name: CVE-2011-1473
            Description: '** DISPUTED ** OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through
                1.x, does not properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within
                the SSL and TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many
                renegotiations within a single connection, a different vulnerability
                than CVE-2011-5094.  NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the responsibility
                of server deployments, not a security library, to prevent or limit
                renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a specific environment.'
        CVE-2011-1468:
            Name: CVE-2011-1468
            Description: Multiple memory leaks in the OpenSSL extension in PHP before
                5.3.6 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
                consumption) via (1) plaintext data to the openssl_encrypt function
                or (2) ciphertext data to the openssl_decrypt function.
        CVE-2011-0014:
            Name: CVE-2011-0014
            Description: ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8h through 0.9.8q and 1.0.0 through
                1.0.0c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash),
                and possibly obtain sensitive information in applications that use
                OpenSSL, via a malformed ClientHello handshake message that triggers
                an out-of-bounds memory access, aka "OCSP stapling vulnerability."
        CVE-2010-5298:
            Name: CVE-2010-5298
            Description: Race condition in the ssl3_read_bytes function in s3_pkt.c
                in OpenSSL through 1.0.1g, when SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled,
                allows remote attackers to inject data across sessions or cause a
                denial of service (use-after-free and parsing error) via an SSL connection
                in a multithreaded environment.
        CVE-2010-5111:
            Name: CVE-2010-5111
            Description: Multiple buffer overflows in readline.c in Echoping 6.0.2
                allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
                execute arbitrary code via a crafted reply in the (1) TLS_readline
                or (2) SSL_readline function, related to the EchoPingHttps Smokeping
                probe.
        CVE-2010-4252:
            Name: CVE-2010-4252
            Description: OpenSSL before 1.0.0c, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly
                validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows
                remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret,
                and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round
                of the protocol.
        CVE-2010-4180:
            Name: CVE-2010-4180
            Description: OpenSSL before 0.9.8q, and 1.0.x before 1.0.0c, when SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG
                is enabled, does not properly prevent modification of the ciphersuite
                in the session cache, which allows remote attackers to force the downgrade
                to an unintended cipher via vectors involving sniffing network traffic
                to discover a session identifier.
        CVE-2010-3864:
            Name: CVE-2010-3864
            Description: Multiple race conditions in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f
                through 0.9.8o, 1.0.0, and 1.0.0a, when multi-threading and internal
                caching are enabled on a TLS server, might allow remote attackers
                to execute arbitrary code via client data that triggers a heap-based
                buffer overflow, related to (1) the TLS server name extension and
                (2) elliptic curve cryptography.
        CVE-2010-2939:
            Name: CVE-2010-2939
            Description: 'Double free vulnerability in the ssl3_get_key_exchange function

        CVE-2010-2450:
            Name: CVE-2010-2450
            Description: The keygen.sh script in Shibboleth SP 2.0 (located in /usr/local/etc/shibboleth
                by default) uses OpenSSL to create a DES private key which is placed
                in sp-key.pm. It relies on the root umask (default 22) instead of
                chmoding the resulting file itself, so the generated private key is
                world readable by default.
        CVE-2010-1633:
            Name: CVE-2010-1633

            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx
                Virtex-II Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm
                for certain signature calculations, and does not verify the signature
                before providing it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically
                proximate attackers to determine the private key via a modified supply
                voltage for the microprocessor, related to a "fault-based attack."

                allows context-dependent attackers to modify invalid memory locations
                or conduct double-free attacks, and possibly execute arbitrary code,
                via unspecified vectors.
        CVE-2010-0740:
            Name: CVE-2010-0740

                2.2.5, and 2.3.x before 2.3.0-beta1, does not properly configure the
                RANDFILE environment variable for OpenSSL, which might make it easier
                for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than
                intended entropy available for cryptographic operations, related to
                inability to write to the seeding file.
        CVE-2008-7270:
            Name: CVE-2008-7270
            Description: OpenSSL before 0.9.8j, when SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG
                is enabled, does not prevent modification of the ciphersuite in the
                session cache, which allows remote attackers to force the use of a
                disabled cipher via vectors involving sniffing network traffic to
                discover a session identifier, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4180.
        CVE-2008-5410:
            Name: CVE-2008-5410
            Description: The PK11_SESSION cache in the OpenSSL PKCS#11 engine in Sun
                Solaris 10 does not maintain reference counts for operations with
                asymmetric keys, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
                a denial of service (failed cryptographic operations) via unspecified
                vectors, related to the (1) RSA_sign and (2) RSA_verify functions.
        CVE-2008-5077:
            Name: CVE-2008-5077
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.8i and earlier does not properly check the return
                value from the EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers
                to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS
                signature for DSA and ECDSA keys.
        CVE-2008-4101:
            Name: CVE-2008-4101
            Description: Vim 3.0 through 7.x before 7.2.010 does not properly escape
                characters, which allows user-assisted attackers to (1) execute arbitrary
                shell commands by entering a K keystroke on a line that contains a
                ";" (semicolon) followed by a command, or execute arbitrary Ex commands
                by entering an argument after a (2) "Ctrl-]" (control close-square-bracket)
                or (3) "g]" (g close-square-bracket) keystroke sequence, a different
                issue than CVE-2008-2712.
        CVE-2008-3432:
            Name: CVE-2008-3432
            Description: Heap-based buffer overflow in the mch_expand_wildcards function
                in os_unix.c in Vim 6.2 and 6.3 allows user-assisted attackers to
                execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in filenames, as demonstrated
                by the netrw.v3 test case.
        CVE-2008-2712:
            Name: CVE-2008-2712
            Description: 'Vim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted
                remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that
                do not properly sanitize inputs before invoking the execute or system
                functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (3) xpm.vim, (4)
                gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.  NOTE: the originally reported version was
                7.1.314, but the researcher actually found this set of issues in 7.1.298.  NOTE:
                the zipplugin issue (originally vector 2 in this identifier) has been
                subsumed by CVE-2008-3075.'
        CVE-2008-2543:
            Name: CVE-2008-2543
            Description: The ooh323 channel driver in Asterisk Addons 1.2.x before
                1.2.9 and Asterisk-Addons 1.4.x before 1.4.7 creates a remotely accessible
                TCP port that is intended solely for localhost communication, and
                interprets some TCP application-data fields as addresses of memory
                to free, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                (daemon crash) via crafted TCP packets.
        CVE-2008-1678:
            Name: CVE-2008-1678
            Description: Memory leak in the zlib_stateful_init function in crypto/comp/c_zlib.c
                in libssl in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h allows remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via multiple calls,
                as demonstrated by initial SSL client handshakes to the Apache HTTP
                Server mod_ssl that specify a compression algorithm.
        CVE-2008-1672:
            Name: CVE-2008-1672
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.8f and 0.9.8g allows remote attackers to cause
                a denial of service (crash) via a TLS handshake that omits the Server
                Key Exchange message and uses "particular cipher suites," which triggers
                a NULL pointer dereference.
        CVE-2008-0891:
            Name: CVE-2008-0891
            Description: 'Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.8f and 0.9.8g,
                when the TLS server name extensions are enabled, allows remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed Client Hello
                packet. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
                information.'
        CVE-2008-0166:
            Name: CVE-2008-0166
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 up to versions before 0.9.8g-9 on Debian-based
                operating systems uses a random number generator that generates predictable
                numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute
                force guessing attacks against cryptographic keys.
        CVE-2007-5536:
            Name: CVE-2007-5536

                denial of service via unspecified vectors.
        CVE-2007-5502:
            Name: CVE-2007-5502
            Description: The PRNG implementation for the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module
                1.1.1 does not perform auto-seeding during the FIPS self-test, which
                generates random data that is more predictable than expected and makes
                it easier for attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that rely
                on the randomness.
        CVE-2007-5135:
            Name: CVE-2007-5135
            Description: 'Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function
                in OpenSSL 0.9.7 up to 0.9.7l, and 0.9.8 up to 0.9.8f, might allow
                remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet that
                triggers a one-byte buffer underflow.  NOTE: this issue was introduced
                as a result of a fix for CVE-2006-3738.  As of 20071012, it is unknown
                whether code execution is possible.'

        CVE-2006-3419:
            Name: CVE-2006-3419
            Description: Tor before 0.1.1.20 uses OpenSSL pseudo-random bytes (RAND_pseudo_bytes)
                instead of cryptographically strong RAND_bytes, and seeds the entropy
                value at start-up with 160-bit chunks without reseeding, which makes
                it easier for attackers to conduct brute force guessing attacks.

                option, disables a verification step that is required for preventing
                protocol version rollback attacks, which allows remote attackers to
                force a client and server to use a weaker protocol than needed via
                a man-in-the-middle attack.
        CVE-2005-2946:
            Name: CVE-2005-2946
            Description: The default configuration on OpenSSL before 0.9.8 uses MD5
                for creating message digests instead of a more cryptographically strong
                algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers to forge certificates
                with a valid certificate authority signature.
        CVE-2005-2532:
            Name: CVE-2005-2532
            Description: OpenVPN before 2.0.1 does not properly flush the OpenSSL
                error queue when a packet can not be decrypted by the server, which
                allows remote authenticated attackers to cause a denial of service
                (client disconnection) via a large number of packets that can not
                be decrypted.
        CVE-2005-2531:
            Name: CVE-2005-2531
            Description: OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with "verb 0" and without
                TLS authentication, does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue
                when a client fails certificate authentication to the server and causes
                the error to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote
                attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via
                a large number of failed authentication attempts.

                message types, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
                service (infinite loop), as demonstrated using the Codenomicon TLS
                Test Tool.
        CVE-2004-0079:
            Name: CVE-2004-0079
            Description: The do_change_cipher_spec function in OpenSSL 0.9.6c to 0.9.6k,
                and 0.9.7a to 0.9.7c, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
                service (crash) via a crafted SSL/TLS handshake that triggers a null
                dereference.
        CVE-2003-0851:
            Name: CVE-2003-0851
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.6k allows remote attackers to cause a denial
                of service (crash via large recursion) via malformed ASN.1 sequences.
        CVE-2003-0545:
            Name: CVE-2003-0545
            Description: Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.7 allows remote
                attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
                arbitrary code via an SSL client certificate with a certain invalid
                ASN.1 encoding.
        CVE-2003-0544:
            Name: CVE-2003-0544
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 does not properly track the number
                of characters in certain ASN.1 inputs, which allows remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate
                that causes OpenSSL to read past the end of a buffer when the long
                form is used.
        CVE-2003-0543:
            Name: CVE-2003-0543
            Description: Integer overflow in OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 allows remote
                attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate
                with certain ASN.1 tag values.
        CVE-2003-0161:
            Name: CVE-2003-0161
            Description: The prescan() function in the address parser (parseaddr.c)
                in Sendmail before 8.12.9 does not properly handle certain conversions
                from char and int types, which can cause a length check to be disabled
                when Sendmail misinterprets an input value as a special "NOCHAR" control
                value, allowing attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
                execute arbitrary code via a buffer overflow attack using messages,
                a different vulnerability than CVE-2002-1337.
        CVE-2003-0147:
            Name: CVE-2003-0147
            Description: OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by default, which allows
                local and remote attackers to obtain the server's private key by determining
                factors using timing differences on (1) the number of extra reductions
                during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of different integer
                multiplication algorithms ("Karatsuba" and normal).
        CVE-2003-0131:
            Name: CVE-2003-0131
            Description: 'The SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL 0.9.6i and earlier,
                0.9.7, and 0.9.7a allow remote attackers to perform an unauthorized
                RSA private key operation via a modified Bleichenbacher attack that
                uses a large number of SSL or TLS connections using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding
                that cause OpenSSL to leak information regarding the relationship
                between ciphertext and the associated plaintext, aka the "Klima-Pokorny-Rosa
                attack."'
        CVE-2003-0086:
            Name: CVE-2003-0086
            Description: The code for writing reg files in Samba before 2.2.8 allows
                local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a race condition involving
                chown.
        CVE-2003-0085:
            Name: CVE-2003-0085
            Description: Buffer overflow in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment re-assembly
                code for SMB daemon (smbd) in Samba before 2.2.8, and Samba-TNG before
                0.3.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
        CVE-2003-0078:
            Name: CVE-2003-0078
            Description: ssl3_get_record in s3_pkt.c for OpenSSL before 0.9.7a and
                0.9.6 before 0.9.6i does not perform a MAC computation if an incorrect
                block cipher padding is used, which causes an information leak (timing
                discrepancy) that may make it easier to launch cryptographic attacks
                that rely on distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors,
                possibly leading to extraction of the original plaintext, aka the
                "Vaudenay timing attack."
        CVE-2002-1568:
            Name: CVE-2002-1568
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.6e uses assertions when detecting buffer overflow
                attacks instead of less severe mechanisms, which allows remote attackers
                to cause a denial of service (crash) via certain messages that cause
                OpenSSL to abort from a failed assertion, as demonstrated using SSLv2
                CLIENT_MASTER_KEY messages, which are not properly handled in s2_srvr.c.
        CVE-2002-0659:
            Name: CVE-2002-0659
            Description: The ASN1 library in OpenSSL 0.9.6d and earlier, and 0.9.7-beta2
                and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                via invalid encodings.
        CVE-2002-0657:
            Name: CVE-2002-0657
            Description: Buffer overflow in OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7-beta3, with
                Kerberos enabled, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
                long master key.
        CVE-2002-0656:
            Name: CVE-2002-0656
            Description: Buffer overflows in OpenSSL 0.9.6d and earlier, and 0.9.7-beta2
                and earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
                (1) a large client master key in SSL2 or (2) a large session ID in
                SSL3.
        CVE-2002-0655:
            Name: CVE-2002-0655
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.6d and earlier, and 0.9.7-beta2 and earlier,
                does not properly handle ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit
                platforms, which could allow attackers to cause a denial of service
                and possibly execute arbitrary code.
        CVE-2001-1141:
            Name: CVE-2001-1141
            Description: The Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in SSLeay and OpenSSL
                before 0.9.6b allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests
                to determine the internal state information, which could be used by
                attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.
        CVE-2000-1254:
            Name: CVE-2000-1254
            Description: crypto/rsa/rsa_gen.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.6 mishandles C
                bitwise-shift operations that exceed the size of an expression, which
                makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection
                mechanisms by leveraging improper RSA key generation on 64-bit HP-UX
                platforms.
        CVE-2000-0535:
            Name: CVE-2000-0535
            Description: OpenSSL 0.9.4 and OpenSSH for FreeBSD do not properly check
                for the existence of the /dev/random or /dev/urandom devices, which
                are absent on FreeBSD Alpha systems, which causes them to produce
                weak keys which may be more easily broken.
        CVE-1999-0428:
            Name: CVE-1999-0428
            Description: OpenSSL and SSLeay allow remote attackers to reuse SSL sessions
                and bypass access controls.
