                Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,
                Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained
                initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
                obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack
                (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that
                uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API,
                or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.

            summary: The integrity check feature in OpenPGP, when handling a message
                that was encrypted using cipher feedback (CFB) mode, allows remote
                attackers to recover part of the plaintext via a chosen-ciphertext
                attack when the first 2 bytes of a message block are known, and an
                oracle or other mechanism is available to determine whether an integrity
                check failed.

        CVE-2019-10639:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-10639
            summary: 'The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8
                allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading
                to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR
                kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for
                connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic
                is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain
                hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain
                the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from
                a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted
                (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This
                attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target
                device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled
                IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the
                server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers
                ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits
                the attacker''s web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force
                UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack
                against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed
                to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.'
        CVE-2019-10638:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-10638
            summary: In the Linux kernel before 5.1.7, a device can be tracked by
                an attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less
                protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple
                destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions
                (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key
                (via enumeration). An attack may be conducted by hosting a crafted
                web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled

        CVE-2021-23839:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-23839
            summary: 'OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate
                SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more
                recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback
                attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or
                TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form
                of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed
                to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form
                of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback
                has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2,
                and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation
                of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt
                is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent.
                This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version
                rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously
                reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made.
                Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected
                by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have
                configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default),
                2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default),
                3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default
                ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore
                is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation
                of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the
                RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although
                1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function
                still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications
                that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter
                this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol
                in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that
                version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public
                updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade
                to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL
                1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).'

            cve_id: CVE-2020-25685
            summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting
                a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(),
                which is the forwarded query that matches the reply, by only using
                a weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq
                is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an
                off-path attacker to find several different domains all having the
                same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would
                have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This
                is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is
                one of the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply.
                This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack.
                If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful
                attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
                data integrity.

            summary: SSH server configuration file does not implement some best practices.
                This could lead to a weakening of the SSH protocol strength, which
                could lead to additional misconfiguration or be leveraged as part

        CVE-2021-21387:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-21387
            summary: Wrongthink peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted messenger with
                PeerJS and Axolotl ratchet. In wrongthink from version 2.0.0 and before
                2.3.0 there was a set of vulnerabilities causing inadequate encryption
                strength. Part of the secret identity key was disclosed by the fingerprint
                used for connection. Additionally, the safety number was improperly
                calculated. It was computed using part of one of the public identity
                keys instead of being derived from both public identity keys. This
                caused issues in computing safety numbers which would potentially
                be exploitable in the real world. Additionally there was inadequate
                encryption strength due to use of 1024-bit DSA keys. These issues
                are all fixed in version 2.3.0.

                the packet sizes would remain observable. The communication encryption
                scheme is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level
                of protection required.

            summary: Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39
                and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's
                password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter
                in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can
                eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the
                response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if
                the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled
                by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and
                the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default.
                The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and
                above.

        CVE-2019-18863:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-18863
            summary: A key length vulnerability in the implementation of the SRTP
                128-bit key on Mitel 6800 and 6900 SIP series phones, versions 5.1.0.2051
                SP2 and earlier, could allow an attacker to launch a man-in-the-middle
                attack when SRTP is used in a call. A successful exploit may allow
                the attacker to intercept sensitive information.
        CVE-2015-5361:
            cve_id: CVE-2015-5361
            summary: Background For regular, unencrypted FTP traffic, the FTP ALG
                can inspect the unencrypted control channel and open related sessions
                for the FTP data channel. These related sessions (gates) are specific
                to source and destination IPs and ports of client and server. The
                design intent of the ftps-extensions option (which is disabled by
                default) is to provide similar functionality when the SRX secures
                the FTP/FTPS client. As the control channel is encrypted, the FTP
                ALG cannot inspect the port specific information and will open a wider
                TCP data channel (gate) from client IP to server IP on all destination
                TCP ports. In FTP/FTPS client environments to an enterprise network
                or the Internet, this is the desired behavior as it allows firewall
                policy to be written to FTP/FTPS servers on well-known control ports
                without using a policy with destination IP ANY and destination port
                ANY. Issue The ftps-extensions option is not intended or recommended
                where the SRX secures the FTPS server, as the wide data channel session
                (gate) will allow the FTPS client temporary access to all TCP ports
                on the FTPS server. The data session is associated to the control
                channel and will be closed when the control channel session closes.
                Depending on the configuration of the FTPS server, supporting load-balancer,
                and SRX inactivity-timeout values, the server/load-balancer and SRX
                may keep the control channel open for an extended period of time,
                allowing an FTPS client access for an equal duration.? Note that the
                ftps-extensions option is not enabled by default.

            summary: JavaEZ is a library that adds new functions to make Java easier.
                A weakness in JavaEZ 1.6 allows force decryption of locked text by
                unauthorized actors. The issue is NOT critical for non-secure applications,
                however may be critical in a situation where the highest levels of
                security are required. This issue ONLY affects v1.6 and does not affect
                anything pre-1.6. The vulnerability has been patched in release 1.7.
                Currently, there is no way to fix the issue without upgrading.
        CVE-2022-29217:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-29217
            summary: PyJWT is a Python implementation of RFC 7519. PyJWT supports
                multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an attacker submitting
                the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library
                requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported.
                The application can specify `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()`
                to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm.
                The issue is not that big as `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()`
                has to be used. Users should upgrade to v2.4.0 to receive a patch
                for this issue. As a workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms
                that are accepted and expected when decoding.

            cve_id: CVE-2022-29161
            summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
                for applications built on top of it. The XWiki Crypto API will generate
                X509 certificates signed by default using SHA1 with RSA, which is
                not considered safe anymore for use in certificate signatures, due
                to the risk of collisions with SHA1. The problem has been patched
                in XWiki version 13.10.6, 14.3.1 and 14.4-rc-1. Since then, the Crypto
                API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA256
                with RSA. Administrators are advised to upgrade their XWiki installation
                to one of the patched versions. If the upgrade is not possible, it
                is possible to patch the module xwiki-platform-crypto in a local installation
                by applying the change exposed in 26728f3 and re-compiling the module.
        CVE-2022-1434:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-1434
            summary: 'The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly
                uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially
                predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a
                man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint
                to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still
                pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL
                3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected
                by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many
                application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the
                server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server
                would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both
                endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being
                sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could
                be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in
                the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint
                communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete
                the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of
                data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt
                data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only
                modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately
                negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled
                by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default
                provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never
                be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0
                endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred:
                1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile
                time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy
                provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via
                configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added
                to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been
                set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must
                have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5
                ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in
                common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).'

                is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to

                the S-Bus ''write byte'' message to a specific address and supplying

            summary: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA,
                WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require
                that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated.
                Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which
                is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject
                arbitrary network packets.

            summary: In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20,
                and greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, it has been
                discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to
                generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data
                having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1)
                and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege
                escalation, insecure deserialization & remote code execution. The
                overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned
                attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session
                (authenticated). This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.

        CVE-2017-14937:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-14937
            summary: The airbag detonation algorithm allows injury to passenger-car
                occupants via predictable Security Access (SA) data to the internal
                CAN bus (or the OBD connector). This affects the airbag control units
                (aka pyrotechnical control units or PCUs) of unspecified passenger
                vehicles manufactured in 2014 or later, when the ignition is on and
                the speed is less than 6 km/h. Specifically, there are only 256 possible
                key pairs, and authentication attempts have no rate limit. In addition,
                at least one manufacturer's interpretation of the ISO 26021 standard
                is that it must be possible to calculate the key directly (i.e., the
                other 255 key pairs must not be used). Exploitation would typically
                involve an attacker who has already gained access to the CAN bus,
                and sends a crafted Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) message to detonate
                the pyrotechnical charges, resulting in the same passenger-injury
                risks as in any airbag deployment.

                In the device's web interface, there is a page that allows an attacker
                to use an unsanitized GET parameter to download files from the device
                as the root user. The attacker can download any file from the device's
                filesystem. This can be used to view unsalted, MD5-hashed administrator
                passwords, which can then be cracked, giving the attacker full admin
                access to the device's web interface. This vulnerability can also
                be used to view the plaintext pre-shared key (PSK) for encrypted wireless

        CVE-2020-5229:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-5229
            summary: Opencast before 8.1 stores passwords using the rather outdated
                and cryptographically insecure MD5 hash algorithm. Furthermore, the
                hashes are salted using the username instead of a random salt, causing
                hashes for users with the same username and password to collide which
                is problematic especially for popular users like the default `admin`
                user. This essentially means that for an attacker, it might be feasible
                to reconstruct a user's password given access to these hashes. Note
                that attackers needing access to the hashes means that they must gain
                access to the database in which these are stored first to be able
                to start cracking the passwords. The problem is addressed in Opencast
                8.1 which now uses the modern and much stronger bcrypt password hashing
                algorithm for storing passwords. Note, that old hashes remain MD5
                until the password is updated. For a list of users whose password
                hashes are stored using MD5, take a look at the `/user-utils/users/md5.json`

            summary: Bond JetSelect (all versions) has an issue in the Java class
                (ENCtool.jar) and corresponding password generation algorithm (used
                to set initial passwords upon first installation). It XORs the plaintext
                into the 'encrypted' password that is then stored within the database.
                These steps are able to be trivially reversed, allowing for escalation
                of privilege within the JetSelect application through obtaining the
                passwords of JetSelect administrators. JetSelect administrators have
                the ability to modify and delete all networking configuration across
                a vessel, as well as altering network configuration of all managed
                network devices (switches, routers).

                before 2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel
                measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing
                the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by
                exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates;
                (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003
                to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective
                coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack
                to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the
                signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient access when
                attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.

            cve_id: CVE-2021-41278
            summary: Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing
                necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting
                data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption
                in app-functions-sdk “AES” transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior
                to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors.
                The app-functions-sdk exports an “aes” transform that user scripts
                can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No
                decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default,
                but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may
                expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry
                Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the
                “aes” transform and provides an improved “aes256” transform in its
                place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state
                until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage
                of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As
                the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by
                default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing
                pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade
                to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use
                the new "aes256" transform.

                In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications
                using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies.
                Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may
                be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites'
                within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched

                attacker can reliably generate a large number of collisions for it.
                This makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision DoS attack,

        CVE-2019-1828:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1828
            summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco
                Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could
                allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access administrative
                credentials. The vulnerability exists because affected devices use
                weak encryption algorithms for user credentials. An attacker could
                exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack
                and decrypting intercepted credentials. A successful exploit could
                allow the attacker to gain access to an affected device with administrator
                privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320
                and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior
                to 1.4.2.22.

        CVE-2019-5723:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-5723
            summary: An issue was discovered in portier vision 4.4.4.2 and 4.4.4.6.
                Passwords are stored using reversible encryption rather than as a
                hash value, and the used Vigenere algorithm is badly outdated. Moreover,
                the encryption key is static and too short. Due to this, the passwords
                stored by the application can be easily decrypted.
        CVE-2019-5919:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-5919
            summary: An incomplete cryptography of the data store function by using
                hidden tag in Nablarch 5 (5, and 5u1 to 5u13) allows remote attackers
                to obtain information of the stored data, to register invalid value,
                or alter the value via unspecified vectors.
        CVE-2019-1543:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1543
            summary: ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce
                input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the
                nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable
                nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than
                12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of
                up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant
                and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement
                of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted
                using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality
                and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce
                length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading
                bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce
                then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with
                a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are
                not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application
                that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long
                nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher,
                including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long
                nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly
                and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may
                be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this
                issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been
                assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases
                at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b). Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.0k (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0j).

            summary: Matrix Synapse before 0.34.0.1, when the macaroon_secret_key
                authentication parameter is not set, uses a predictable value to derive

        CVE-2019-1543:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1543
            summary: ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce
                input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the
                nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable
                nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than
                12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of
                up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant
                and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement
                of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted
                using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality
                and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce
                length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading
                bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce
                then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with
                a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are
                not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application
                that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long
                nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher,
                including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long
                nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly
                and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may
                be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this
                issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been
                assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases
                at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1b). Fixed
                in OpenSSL 1.1.0k (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0j).

                to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo
                CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently
                random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case,
                using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a non-cryptographically-secure

                required by the relevant spec or by general best practices. In some
                cases, using too short a value made the entropy even less sufficient.
                The attacks on login flows which are meant to be mitigated by these

        CVE-2021-28674:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-28674
            summary: The node management page in SolarWinds Orion Platform before
                2020.2.5 HF1 allows an attacker to create or delete a node (outside
                of the attacker's perimeter) via an account with write permissions.
                This occurs because node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers)
                and the access control on Services/NodeManagement.asmx/DeleteObjNow
                is incorrect. To exploit this, an attacker must be authenticated and
                must have node management rights associated with at least one valid
                group on the platform.
        CVE-2021-32791:

            summary: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for
                the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying
                Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In
                mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption in mod_auth_openidc
                uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix because this creates
                a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead
                to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused.
                From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through
                usage of cjose AES encryption routines.
        CVE-2021-29480:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-29480
            summary: Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions
                prior to 1.9.0, the client side session module uses the application
                startup time as the signing key by default. This means that if an
                attacker can determine this time, and if encryption is not also used
                (which is recommended, but is not on by default), the session data
                could be tampered with by someone with the ability to write cookies.
                The default configuration is unsuitable for production use as an application
                restart renders all sessions invalid and is not multi-host compatible,
                but its use is not actively prevented. As of Ratpack 1.9.0, the default
                value is a securely randomly generated value, generated at application
                startup time. As a workaround, supply an alternative signing key,
                as per the documentation's recommendation.

        CVE-2020-11501:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-11501
            summary: GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS.
                The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an
                error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\0'
                bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness
                to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the
                DTLS protocol.

        CVE-2018-19441:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-19441
            summary: An issue was discovered in Neato Botvac Connected 2.2.0. The
                GenerateRobotPassword function of the NeatoCrypto library generates
                insufficiently random numbers for robot secret_key values used for
                local and cloud authentication/authorization. If an attacker knows
                the serial number and is able to estimate the time of first provisioning
                of a robot, he is able to brute force the generated secret_key of
                the robot. This is because the entropy of the secret_key exclusively
                relies on these two values, due to not seeding the random generator
                and using several constant inputs for secret_key computation. Serial
                numbers are printed on the packaging and equal the MAC address of
                the robot.
        CVE-2020-7241:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-7241
            summary: The WP Database Backup plugin through 5.5 for WordPress stores
                downloads by default locally in the directory wp-content/uploads/db-backup/.
                This might allow attackers to read ZIP archives by guessing random
                ID numbers, guessing date strings with a 2020_{0..1}{0..2}_{0..3}{0..9}
                format, guessing UNIX timestamps, and making HTTPS requests with the
                complete guessed URL.
        CVE-2019-18282:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-18282
            summary: The flow_dissector feature in the Linux kernel 4.3 through 5.x
                before 5.3.10 has a device tracking vulnerability, aka CID-55667441c84f.
                This occurs because the auto flowlabel of a UDP IPv6 packet relies
                on a 32-bit hashrnd value as a secret, and because jhash (instead
                of siphash) is used. The hashrnd value remains the same starting from
                boot time, and can be inferred by an attacker. This affects net/core/flow_dissector.c
                and related code.

            summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass
                authentication on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WR940N 6_211111
                3.20.1(US) routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this
                vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service,
                which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the
                lack of sufficient randomness in the sequnce numbers used for session
                managment. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication
                on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-18334.

            summary: A vulnerability in the backup configuration feature of Cisco
                UCS Manager Software and in the configuration export feature of Cisco
                FXOS Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker with access
                to a backup file to decrypt sensitive information stored in the full
                state and configuration backup files. This vulnerability is due to
                a weakness in the encryption method used for the backup function.
                An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a static
                key used for the backup configuration feature. A successful exploit
                could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive information that is
                stored in full state and configuration backup files, such as local
                user credentials, authentication server passwords, Simple Network
                Management Protocol (SNMP) community names, and other credentials.

            summary: CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering
                data hubs and data portals. When creating a new container based on
                one of the Docker images listed below, the same secret key was being
                used by default. If the users didn't set a custom value via environment
                variables in the `.env` file, that key was shared across different
                CKAN instances, making it easy to forge authentication requests. Users
                overriding the default secret key in their own `.env` file are not
                affected by this issue. Note that the legacy images (ckan/ckan) located
                in the main CKAN repo are not affected by this issue. The affected

                EEC (PRP) (All versions < V3.2.7), SCALANCE X204RNA EEC (PRP/HSR)
                (All versions < V3.2.7). The webserver of affected devices calculates
                session ids and nonces in an insecure manner. This could allow an
                unauthenticated remote attacker to brute-force session ids and hijack
                existing sessions.
        CVE-2022-20941:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-20941
            summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco
                Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
                remote attacker to access sensitive information. This vulnerability
                is due to missing authorization for certain resources in the web-based
                management interface together with insufficient entropy in these resource
                names. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series
                of HTTPS requests to an affected device to enumerate resources on
                the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve
                sensitive information from the device.

            summary: Multiple W&T products of the Comserver Series use a small number
                space for allocating sessions ids. After login of an user an unathenticated
                remote attacker can brute force the users session id and get access

        CVE-2022-44795:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-44795
            summary: An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712.
                A flaw was found in the Web Service, which could lead to local information
                disclosure. The command that creates the URL for the support bundle
                uses an insecure RNG. That can lead to prediction of the generated
                URL. As a result, an attacker can get access to system logs. An attacker
                would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed
                in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611. Important note - This
                vulnerability is related to the Object First Ootbi BETA version, which
                is not released for production and therefore has no impact on the
                production environment. The production-ready Object First Ootbi version
                will have this vulnerability fixed.

            cve_id: CVE-2022-31008
            summary: 'RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker.
                In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI
                obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used
                to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means
                that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation
                plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the
                node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for
                that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions:
                `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade
                should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.'

            summary: An authorization bypass in b2evolution allows remote, unauthenticated
                attackers to predict password reset tokens for any user through the
                use of a bad randomness function. This allows the attacker to get
                valid sessions for arbitrary users, and optionally reset their password.

        CVE-2021-20322:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-20322
            summary: A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment
                needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found
                to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows
                an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP
                randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality
                and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source
                port randomization are indirectly affected as well.

        CVE-2021-22038:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-22038
            summary: On Windows, the uninstaller binary copies itself to a fixed temporary
                location, which is then executed (the originally called uninstaller
                exits, so it does not block the installation directory). This temporary
                location is not randomized and does not restrict access to Administrators
                only so a potential attacker could plant a binary to replace the copied
                binary right before it gets called, thus gaining Administrator privileges
                (if the original uninstaller was executed as Administrator). The vulnerability
                only affects Windows installers.

            summary: Versions up to, and including, 5.4.3, of the Booster for WooCommerce
                WordPress plugin are vulnerable to authentication bypass via the process_email_verification
                function due to a random token generation weakness in the reset_and_mail_activation_link
                function found in the ~/includes/class-wcj-emails-verification.php
                file. This allows attackers to impersonate users and trigger an email
                address verification for arbitrary accounts, including administrative
                accounts, and automatically be logged in as that user, including any
                site administrators. This requires the Email Verification module to
                be active in the plugin and the Login User After Successful Verification
                setting to be enabled, which it is by default.

            cve_id: CVE-2021-3446
            summary: A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly
                used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability
                related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric
                ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the
                initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption
                and decryption steps. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
                to data confidentiality.

            summary: An issue was discovered on Sigma Design Z-Wave S0 through S2
                devices. An attacker first prepares a Z-Wave frame-transmission program
                (e.g., Z-Wave PC Controller, OpenZWave, CC1110, etc.). Next, the attacker
                conducts a DoS attack against the Z-Wave S0 Security version product
                by continuously sending divided "Nonce Get (0x98 0x81)" frames. The
                reason for dividing the "Nonce Get" frame is that, in security version
                S0, when a node receives a "Nonce Get" frame, the node produces a
                random new nonce and sends it to the Src node of the received "Nonce
                Get" frame. After the nonce value is generated and transmitted, the
                node transitions to wait mode. At this time, when "Nonce Get" is received
                again, the node discards the previous nonce value and generates a
                random nonce again. Therefore, because the frame is encrypted with

        CVE-2017-17704:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-17704
            summary: A door-unlocking issue was discovered on Software House iStar
                Ultra devices through 6.5.2.20569 when used in conjunction with the
                IP-ACM Ethernet Door Module. The communications between the IP-ACM
                and the iStar Ultra is encrypted using a fixed AES key and IV. Each
                message is encrypted in CBC mode and restarts with the fixed IV, leading
                to replay attacks of entire messages. There is no authentication of
                messages beyond the use of the fixed AES key, so message forgery is
                also possible.
        CVE-2017-17910:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-17910
            summary: On Hoermann BiSecur devices before 2018, a vulnerability can
                be exploited by recording a single radio transmission. An attacker
                can intercept an arbitrary radio frame exchanged between a BiSecur
                transmitter and a receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the
                32-bit serial number. The interception of the one-time pairing process
                is specifically not required. Due to use of AES-128 with an initial
                static random value and static data vector (all of this static information
                is the same across different customers' installations), the attacker
                can easily derive the utilized encryption key and decrypt the intercepted
                packet. The key can be verified by decrypting the intercepted packet
                and checking for known plaintext. Subsequently, an attacker can create
                arbitrary radio frames with the correct encryption key to control
                BiSecur garage and entrance gate operators and possibly other BiSecur
                systems as well ("wireless cloning"). To conduct the attack, a low
                cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) is sufficient. This affects Hoermann
                Hand Transmitter HS5-868-BS, HSE1-868-BS, and HSE2-868-BS devices.

        CVE-2019-10084:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-10084
            summary: In Apache Impala 2.7.0 to 3.2.0, an authenticated user with access
                to the IDs of active Impala queries or sessions can interact with
                those sessions or queries via a specially-constructed request and
                thereby potentially bypass authorization and audit mechanisms. Session
                and query IDs are unique and random, but have not been documented
                or consistently treated as sensitive secrets. Therefore they may be
                exposed in logs or interfaces. They were also not generated with a
                cryptographically secure random number generator, so are vulnerable
                to random number generator attacks that predict future IDs based on
                past IDs. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization
                enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated
                attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated
                user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments
                with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging
                as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name
                of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires
                a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala
                system as an authenticated user.

        CVE-2019-1549:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1549
            summary: OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator
                (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork()
                system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes
                did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not
                being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue
                is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG
                state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state
                is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto()
                explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur
                at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).

                4.4.2 does not verify X.509 certificates from TLS servers, which allows
                man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof LDAPS and HTTPS servers and obtain
                sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
        CVE-2016-2306:
            cve_id: CVE-2016-2306
            summary: The HMI web server in Ecava IntegraXor before 5.0 build 4522
                allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information
                by sniffing the network.
        CVE-2013-7449:
            cve_id: CVE-2013-7449
            summary: The ssl_do_connect function in common/server.c in HexChat before
                2.10.2, XChat, and XChat-GNOME does not verify that the server hostname
                matches a domain name in the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
                attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
        CVE-2016-3071:
            cve_id: CVE-2016-3071

            summary: The mod_tls module in ProFTPD before 1.3.5b and 1.3.6 before
                1.3.6rc2 does not properly handle the TLSDHParamFile directive, which
                might cause a weaker than intended Diffie-Hellman (DH) key to be used
                and consequently allow attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown
                vectors.
        CVE-2016-1788:
            cve_id: CVE-2016-1788

        CVE-2017-7526:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-7526
            summary: libgcrypt before version 1.7.8 is vulnerable to a cache side-channel
                attack resulting into a complete break of RSA-1024 while using the
                left-to-right method for computing the sliding-window expansion. The
                same attack is believed to work on RSA-2048 with moderately more computation.
                This side-channel requires that attacker can run arbitrary software
                on the hardware where the private RSA key is used.
        CVE-2017-3226:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-3226
            summary: Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration
                from an AES encrypted file. Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's
                AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting
                the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables
                from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with
                physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment
                data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error
                in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly
                handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination
                with a debugging message.
        CVE-2017-3225:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-3225
            summary: Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration
                from an AES encrypted file. For devices utilizing this environment
                encryption mode, U-Boot's use of a zero initialization vector may
                allow attacks against the underlying cryptographic implementation
                and allow an attacker to decrypt the data. Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption
                feature uses a zero (0) initialization vector. This allows an attacker
                to perform dictionary attacks on encrypted data produced by Das U-Boot
                to learn information about the encrypted data.

            summary: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the
                primary engine class used for AES was AESFastEngine. Due to the highly
                table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out that if the
                data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses
                are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used. There
                was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine
                has been modified to remove any signs of leakage (testing carried
                out on Intel X86-64) and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE
                provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine is now only recommended where
                otherwise deemed appropriate.

                software. The two package names involved in the exfiltration are com.adups.fota

                file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system
                which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged
                user on the device. Therefore, the app executing as the system user
                has been granted a number of powerful permissions even though they
                are not present in the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml
                file. This app provides the com.adups.fota app access to the user's
                call log, text messages, and various device identifiers through the
                com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider component. The com.adups.fota
                app uses timestamps when it runs and is eligible to exfiltrate the
                user's PII every 72 hours. If 72 hours have passed since the value
                of the timestamp, then the exfiltration will be triggered by the user
                plugging in the device to charge or when they leave or enter a wireless
                network. The exfiltration occurs in the background without any user
                interaction.

            summary: 'An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices
                with Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed
                as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper
                app''s AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId
                attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute
                as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device.
                The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver
                which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app
                can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by
                the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system
                user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can
                perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset
                the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video,
                install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others.
                In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will
                make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do
                where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON
                Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user.
                Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM
                attack.'

            cve_id: CVE-2016-9847
            summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not
                specify a blowfish_secret key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates
                one at runtime. A vulnerability was reported where the way this value
                is created uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to
                determine the user's blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt their
                cookies. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior
                to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.
        CVE-2016-6606:
            cve_id: CVE-2016-6606
            summary: An issue was discovered in cookie encryption in phpMyAdmin. The
                decryption of the username/password is vulnerable to a padding oracle
                attack. This can allow an attacker who has access to a user's browser
                cookie file to decrypt the username and password. Furthermore, the
                same initialization vector (IV) is used to hash the username and password
                stored in the phpMyAdmin cookie. If a user has the same password as
                their username, an attacker who examines the browser cookie can see
                that they are the same - but the attacker can not directly decode
                these values from the cookie as it is still hashed. All 4.6.x versions
                (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions

            cve_id: CVE-2019-14261
            summary: An issue was discovered on ABUS Secvest FUAA50000 3.01.01 devices.
                Due to an insufficient implementation of jamming detection, an attacker
                is able to suppress correctly received RF messages sent between wireless
                peripheral components, e.g., wireless detectors or remote controls,
                and the ABUS Secvest alarm central. An attacker is able to perform
                a "reactive jamming" attack. The reactive jamming simply detects the
                start of a RF message sent by a component of the ABUS Secvest wireless
                alarm system, for instance a wireless motion detector (FUBW50000)
                or a remote control (FUBE50014 or FUBE50015), and overlays it with
                random data before the original RF message ends. Thereby, the receiver
                (alarm central) is not able to properly decode the original transmitted
                signal. This enables an attacker to suppress correctly received RF
                messages of the wireless alarm system in an unauthorized manner, for
                instance status messages sent by a detector indicating an intrusion.

                for Java) supports the Extended Random extension during use of the
                Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers
                to obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by requesting long nonces from
                a server, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.
        CVE-2014-4192:
            cve_id: CVE-2014-4192
            summary: The Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-C Toolkits (aka
                Share for C and C++) processes certain requests for output bytes by
                considering only the requested byte count and not the use of cached
                bytes, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext
                from TLS sessions by recovering the algorithm's inner state, a different
                issue than CVE-2007-6755.
        CVE-2014-4191:
            cve_id: CVE-2014-4191
            summary: The TLS implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-C Toolkits (aka Share
                for C and C++) sends a long series of random bytes during use of the
                Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers
                to obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by recovering the algorithm's
                inner state, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.
        CVE-2014-4040:

            summary: snap in powerpc-utils 1.2.20 produces an archive with fstab and
                yaboot.conf files potentially containing cleartext passwords, and
                lacks a warning about reviewing this archive to detect included passwords,
                which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
                by leveraging access to a technical-support data stream.
        CVE-2013-6078:
            cve_id: CVE-2013-6078
            summary: 'The default configuration of EMC RSA BSAFE Toolkits and RSA
                Data Protection Manager (DPM) 20130918 uses the Dual Elliptic Curve
                Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm, which
                makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic
                protection mechanisms by leveraging unspecified "security concerns,"
                aka the ESA-2013-068 issue.  NOTE: this issue has been SPLIT from
                CVE-2007-6755 because the vendor announcement did not state a specific
                technical rationale for a change in the algorithm; thus, CVE cannot
                reach a conclusion that a CVE-2007-6755 concern was the reason, or
                one of the reasons, for this change.'
        CVE-2011-4303:
            cve_id: CVE-2011-4303
            summary: lib/db/upgrade.php in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.5 and 2.1.x before
                2.1.2 does not set the correct registration_hubs.secret value during
                installation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
                restrictions by leveraging the hubs feature.
        CVE-2012-3372:
            cve_id: CVE-2012-3372

                uses the same Certification Authority certificate and same private
                key across different customers'' installations, which makes it easier
                for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging
                the presence of the Cyberoam_SSL_CA certificate in a list of trusted
                root certification authorities.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance
                of this issue because the appliance "does not allow import or export
                of the foresaid private key."'
        CVE-2012-2143:
            cve_id: CVE-2012-2143

            summary: Passlogix v-GO Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) and OEM before
                7.0A allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary programs
                without authentication by triggering use of an invalid SSL certificate
                and using the Internet Explorer interface to navigate through the
                filesystem via a "Save As" dialog that is reachable from the "Certificate
                Export" wizard.
        CVE-2011-0009:
            cve_id: CVE-2011-0009
            summary: Best Practical Solutions RT 3.x before 3.8.9rc2 and 4.x before
                4.0.0rc4 uses the MD5 algorithm for password hashes, which makes it
                easier for context-dependent attackers to determine cleartext passwords
                via a brute-force attack on the database.
        CVE-2011-0410:
            cve_id: CVE-2011-0410
            summary: CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic 1.8.4 uses cleartext credentials for
                network communication and the internal database, which makes it easier
                for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by
                (1) sniffing the network for transmissions of Java objects or (2)
                reading the database.
        CVE-2011-0002:
            cve_id: CVE-2011-0002
            summary: libuser before 0.57 uses a cleartext password value of (1) !!
                or (2) x for new LDAP user accounts, which makes it easier for remote
                attackers to obtain access by specifying one of these values.
        CVE-2010-4334:
            cve_id: CVE-2010-4334
            summary: The IO::Socket::SSL module 1.35 for Perl, when verify_mode is
                not VERIFY_NONE, fails open to VERIFY_NONE instead of throwing an
                error when a ca_file/ca_path cannot be verified, which allows remote
                attackers to bypass intended certificate restrictions.
        CVE-2010-4626:
            cve_id: CVE-2010-4626
            summary: The my_rand function in functions.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard)
                before 1.4.12 does not properly use the PHP mt_rand function, which
                makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to an arbitrary
                account by requesting a reset of the account's password, and then
                conducting a brute-force attack.
        CVE-2010-4584:
            cve_id: CVE-2010-4584
            summary: Opera before 11.00, when Opera Turbo is used, does not properly
                present information about problematic X.509 certificates on https
                web sites, which might make it easier for remote attackers to spoof
                trusted content via a crafted web site.
        CVE-2010-2603:
            cve_id: CVE-2010-2603

                for Mac, uses a weak password to encrypt a database backup file, which
                makes it easier for local users to decrypt the file via a brute force
                attack.
        CVE-2009-5032:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-5032
            summary: The encrypted e-mail feature in IBM Lotus Notes Traveler before
                8.5.0.2 sends unencrypted messages when the feature is used without
                uploading a Notes ID file, which makes it easier for remote attackers
                to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.
        CVE-2008-7270:
            cve_id: CVE-2008-7270
            summary: OpenSSL before 0.9.8j, when SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG
                is enabled, does not prevent modification of the ciphersuite in the
                session cache, which allows remote attackers to force the use of a
                disabled cipher via vectors involving sniffing network traffic to
                discover a session identifier, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4180.
        CVE-2010-4020:
            cve_id: CVE-2010-4020
            summary: MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.8.x through 1.8.3 does not reject
                RC4 key-derivation checksums, which might allow remote authenticated
                users to forge a (1) AD-SIGNEDPATH or (2) AD-KDC-ISSUED signature,
                and possibly gain privileges, by leveraging the small key space that
                results from certain one-byte stream-cipher operations.
        CVE-2009-3026:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-3026
            summary: protocols/jabber/auth.c in libpurple in Pidgin 2.6.0, and possibly
                other versions, does not follow the "require TLS/SSL" preference when
                connecting to older Jabber servers that do not follow the XMPP specification,
                which causes libpurple to connect to the server without the expected
                encryption and allows remote attackers to sniff sessions.
        CVE-2009-3024:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-3024
            summary: The verify_hostname_of_cert function in the certificate checking
                feature in IO-Socket-SSL (IO::Socket::SSL) 1.14 through 1.25 only
                matches the prefix of a hostname when no wildcard is used, which allows
                remote attackers to bypass the hostname check for a certificate.
        CVE-2008-7113:
            cve_id: CVE-2008-7113
            summary: The Scanner File Utility (aka listener) in Kyocera Mita (KM)
                3.3.0.1 uses a small space of predictable user identification numbers
                for access control, which allows remote attackers to upload documents
                via a brute force attack.
        CVE-2009-2977:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-2977
            summary: The Cisco Security Monitoring, Analysis and Response System (CS-MARS)
                6.0.4 and earlier stores cleartext passwords in log/sysbacktrace.##
                files within error-logs.tar.gz archives, which allows context-dependent
                attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading these files.
        CVE-2009-2976:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-2976
            summary: Cisco Aironet Lightweight Access Point (AP) devices send the
                contents of certain multicast data frames in cleartext, which allows
                remote attackers to discover Wireless LAN Controller MAC addresses
                and IP addresses, and AP configuration details, by sniffing the wireless
                network.
        CVE-2009-2973:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-2973
            summary: Google Chrome before 2.0.172.43 does not prevent SSL connections
                to a site with an X.509 certificate signed with the (1) MD2 or (2)
                MD4 algorithm, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers
                to spoof arbitrary HTTPS servers via a crafted certificate, a related
                issue to CVE-2009-2409.
        CVE-2009-2951:
            cve_id: CVE-2009-2951

            summary: The SSH-1 protocol allows remote servers to conduct man-in-the-middle
                attacks and replay a client challenge response to a target server
                by creating a Session ID that matches the Session ID of the target,
                but which uses a public key pair that is weaker than the target's
                public key, which allows the attacker to compute the corresponding
                private key and use the target's Session ID with the compromised key
                pair to masquerade as the target.
        CVE-2000-0589:
            cve_id: CVE-2000-0589
            summary: SawMill 5.0.21 uses weak encryption to store passwords, which

                go wrong is seeding the CMAC implementation with "true" random data
                in the function `defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator,
                the library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript
                execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971).
                However, in a nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is
                not defined, so it goes down a much less secure solution, also of
                which has a bug in it. It does look like the library tries to use
                node''s CSPRNG when possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto`
                object is null because a variable was declared with the same name,
                and set to `null`. So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However,
                when `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer
                LCG random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and
                the LCG is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would
                likely qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the
                extreme frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The
                output from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008]
                with the flaw is: `b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The
                [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352)
                of `putByte` is `util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data
                += String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next
                & 0xFF))`. The double `String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional
                and the source of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result
                in an error. Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros.
                Since we are masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output
                from the LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result
                in meaningful values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact
                is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due
                to incorrect conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9.
                In summary, there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has
                an insecure random number fallback path. Ideally the library would
                require a strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`.
                2. The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator
                when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The
                fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority
                of the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor
                random number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively
                easy to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential
                messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the
                victim.'

            cve_id: CVE-2021-32033
            summary: Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a Time Traveler attack
                in which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations.
                The time value used by the device can be set independently from the
                used seed value for generating time-based one-time passwords, without
                authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access
                to a device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future,
                generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time.
                This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time passwords
                without having further access to the hardware token.

                IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 3850, Cisco Catalyst 9300,
                and Cisco Catalyst 9300L Series Switches could allow an authenticated,
                local attacker to either execute arbitrary code on the underlying
                operating system, install and boot a malicious software image, or
                execute unsigned binaries on an affected device. These vulnerabilities
                are due to improper checks performed by system boot routines. To exploit
                these vulnerabilities, the attacker would need privileged access to
                the CLI of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
                to either execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system
                or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check part
                of the secure boot process. For more information about these vulnerabilities,

        CVE-2021-1453:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-1453
            summary: A vulnerability in the software image verification functionality
                of Cisco IOS XE Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family of switches
                could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to execute unsigned
                code at system boot time. The vulnerability is due to an improper
                check in the code function that manages the verification of the digital
                signatures of system image files during the initial boot process.
                An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software
                on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
                to boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass
                the image verification check part of the secure boot process of an
                affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would
                need to have unauthenticated physical access to the device or obtain
                privileged access to the root shell on the device.

        CVE-2021-21239:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-21239
            summary: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
                PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic
                signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1
                backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2
                does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The
                default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to
                verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1
                accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs
                to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for
                the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed
                in PySAML2 6.5.0.
        CVE-2021-21238:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-21238
            summary: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
                PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic
                signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate
                signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant
                of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document
                against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed
                and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This
                is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

            summary: Dex is a federated OpenID Connect provider written in Go. In
                Dex before version 2.27.0 there is a critical set of vulnerabilities
                which impacts users leveraging the SAML connector. The vulnerabilities
                enables potential signature bypass due to issues with XML encoding
                in the underlying Go library. The vulnerabilities have been addressed
                in version 2.27.0 by using the xml-roundtrip-validator from Mattermost

            summary: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed
                ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy
                before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on
                a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized
                alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will
                be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed,
                regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can
                ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role).
                This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the
                ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions),
                2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction
                modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

            summary: A crafted S/MIME message consisting of an inner encryption layer
                and an outer SignedData layer was shown as having a valid digital
                signature, although the signer might have had no access to the contents
                of the encrypted message, and might have stripped a different signature
                from the encrypted message. Previous versions had only suppressed
                showing a digital signature for messages with an outer multipart/signed
                layer. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.1.1.
        CVE-2019-12662:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-12662
            summary: A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software
                could allow an authenticated, local attacker with valid administrator
                or privilege level 15 credentials to load a virtual service image
                and bypass signature verification on an affected device. The vulnerability
                is due to improper signature verification during the installation
                of an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image. An authenticated, local
                attacker could exploit this vulnerability and load a malicious, unsigned
                OVA image on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
                an attacker to perform code execution on a crafted software OVA image.
        CVE-2019-12649:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-12649
            summary: A vulnerability in the Image Verification feature of Cisco IOS
                XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install
                and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries on
                an affected device. The vulnerability exists because, under certain
                circumstances, an affected device can be configured to not verify
                the digital signatures of system image files during the boot process.
                An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by abusing a specific
                feature that is part of the device boot process. A successful exploit
                could allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software
                image or execute unsigned binaries on the targeted device.

        CVE-2019-10201:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-10201
            summary: It was found that Keycloak's SAML broker, versions up to 6.0.1,
                did not verify missing message signatures. If an attacker modifies
                the SAML Response and removes the <Signature> sections, the message
                is still accepted, and the message can be modified. An attacker could
                use this flaw to impersonate other users and gain access to sensitive
                information.
        CVE-2020-24429:

        CVE-2020-28045:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-28045
            summary: An unsigned-library issue was discovered in ProlinOS through
                2.4.161.8859R. This OS requires installed applications and all system
                binaries to be signed either by the manufacturer or by the Point Of
                Sale application developer and distributor. The signature is a 2048-byte
                RSA signature verified in the kernel prior to ELF execution. Shared
                libraries, however, do not need to be signed, and they are not verified.
                An attacker may execute a custom binary by compiling it as a shared
                object and loading it via LD_PRELOAD.

                before 2.8.15 and ansible-engine 2.9.x before 2.9.13, when installing
                packages using the dnf module. GPG signatures are ignored during installation
                even when disable_gpg_check is set to False, which is the default
                behavior. This flaw leads to malicious packages being installed on
                the system and arbitrary code executed via package installation scripts.
                The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity and system
                availability.
        CVE-2019-1736:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1736
            summary: A vulnerability in the firmware of the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack
                Servers could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass
                Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot validation
                checks and load a compromised software image on an affected device.
                The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the server firmware
                upgrade images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing
                a server firmware version that would allow the attacker to disable
                UEFI Secure Boot. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
                bypass the signature validation checks that are done by UEFI Secure
                Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected
                device. A compromised software image is any software image that has
                not been digitally signed by Cisco.

            summary: A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions),
                which could lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per
                upstream, a signature bypass is theoretically possible, but not practical
                because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) is either not implemented
                or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux
                7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality
                and integrity.

                (i.e., the Django Signing API is misused), which allows remote attackers
                to spoof the verification process. This occurs because incorrect code
                refactoring led to calling a security-critical function with an incorrect
                argument.
        CVE-2019-10136:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-10136
            summary: It was found that Spacewalk, all versions through 2.9, did not
                safely compute client token checksums. An attacker with a valid, but
                expired, authenticated set of headers could move some digits around,
                artificially extending the session validity without modifying the
                checksum.
        CVE-2019-5300:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-5300
            summary: There is a digital signature verification bypass vulnerability
                in AR1200, AR1200-S, AR150, AR160, AR200, AR2200, AR2200-S, AR3200,
                SRG1300, SRG2300 and SRG3300 Huawei routers. The vulnerability is
                due to the affected software improperly verifying digital signatures
                for the software image in the affected device. A local attacker with
                high privilege may exploit the vulnerability to bypass integrity checks
                for software images and install a malicious software image on the
                affected device.
        CVE-2019-11841:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-11841
            summary: A message-forgery issue was discovered in crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go
                in supplementary Go cryptography libraries 2019-03-25. According to
                the OpenPGP Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a
                cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional "Hash" Armor
                Headers. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s)
                used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores
                the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently,
                an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated
                using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually
                used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general,
                an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend
                arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating the signatures.

        CVE-2019-8338:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-8338
            summary: The signature verification routine in the Airmail GPG-PGP Plugin,
                versions 1.0 (9) and earlier, does not verify the status of the signature
                at all, which allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary email signatures
                by crafting a signed email with an invalid signature. Also, it does
                not verify the validity of the signing key, which allows remote attackers
                to spoof arbitrary email signatures by crafting a key with a fake
                user ID (email address) and injecting it into the user's keyring.
        CVE-2018-12556:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-12556
            summary: The signature verification routine in install.sh in yarnpkg/website
                through 2018-06-05 only verifies that the yarn release is signed by
                any (arbitrary) key in the local keyring of the user, and does not
                pin the signature to the yarn release key, which allows remote attackers
                to sign tampered yarn release packages with their own key.

                it without an explicit configuration on its side or for the "idtoken"
                response type which is not secure and violates the OpenID Core Specification.
                The "none" algorithm does not require any signature verification when
                validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker to bypass the
                token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using "none" as
                the value of "alg" key in the header with an empty signature value.

            summary: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper
                access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware
                update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious
                in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation
                done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes
                firmware updates that are done via the automated "check for updates"
                in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the
                update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates
                downloaded are legitimate.

            summary: Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport,
                the Node.js authentication library. A remote attacker may be able
                to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A
                successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an
                arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully
                unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might
                also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.
                Users should upgrade to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The
                issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before
                version 4.0.0-beta.5. If you cannot upgrade, disabling SAML authentication

            cve_id: CVE-2022-20944
            summary: 'A vulnerability in the software image verification functionality
                of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series Switches could
                allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to execute unsigned code
                at system boot time. This vulnerability is due to an improper check
                in the code function that manages the verification of the digital
                signatures of system image files during the initial boot process.
                An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software
                on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
                to boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass
                the image verification check part of the boot process of the affected
                device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs either unauthenticated
                physical access to the device or privileged access to the root shell
                on the device. Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and
                later, root shell access is protected by the Consent Token mechanism.
                However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade
                the Cisco IOS XE Software running on a device to a release where root
                shell access is more readily available.'

            summary: Cosign is a project under the sigstore organization which aims
                to make signatures invisible infrastructure. In versions prior to
                1.12.0 a number of vulnerabilities have been found in cosign verify-blob,
                where Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification
                should have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully
                verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference
                the given signature. Second, when providing identity flags, the email
                and issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor
                bundle, and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked. Third, providing
                an invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag results in a
                successful verification. And fourth an invalid transparency log entry
                will result in immediate success for verification. Details and examples
                of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 advisory linked.
                Users are advised to upgrade to 1.12.0. There are no known workarounds
                for these issues.

                events retrieved from a remote homeserver using the `/get_missing_events`
                path did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could
                potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified

                to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`)
                as they have been correctly verified. Homeservers that have federation
                disabled are not vulnerable. The problem has been fixed in Dendrite

        CVE-2021-3521:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-3521
            summary: There is a flaw in RPM's signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys
                are associated with a primary key via a "binding signature." RPM does
                not check the binding signature of subkeys prior to importing them.
                If an attacker is able to add or socially engineer another party to
                add a malicious subkey to a legitimate public key, RPM could wrongly
                trust a malicious signature. The greatest impact of this flaw is to
                data integrity. To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise
                an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted
                RPM or public key. It is strongly recommended to only use RPMs and
                public keys from trusted sources.

            summary: cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions
                prior to 1.10.1 cosign can report a false positive if any attestation
                exists. `cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will
                report a false positive verification when there is at least one attestation
                with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being
                verified (--type defaults to "custom"). This can happen when signing
                with a standard keypair and with "keyless" signing with Fulcio. This
                vulnerability can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2`

        CVE-2022-31207:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-31207
            summary: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series,
                and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication.
                They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes,
                including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This
                protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control
                logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program
                Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory
                using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory
                for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the
                user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution,
                these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines
                whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor.
                In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas
                in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor
                for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal
                case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal
                condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded
                to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus
                allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the
                PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC
                or on the microprocessor interpreter.
        CVE-2021-23992:

            summary: Thunderbird did not check if the user ID associated with an OpenPGP
                key has a valid self signature. An attacker may create a crafted version
                of an OpenPGP key, by either replacing the original user ID, or by
                adding another user ID. If Thunderbird imports and accepts the crafted
                key, the Thunderbird user may falsely conclude that the false user
                ID belongs to the correspondent. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
                < 78.9.1.

                11.0.0 through 11.1.3, 12.0.0 through 12.0.2, and 12.1.0. When using
                federated identity management (authenticating via SAML through a third-party
                identity provider), an attacker can inject additional data into a
                signed SAML response being transmitted to the service provider (ID
                Bravura Security Fabric). The application successfully validates the
                signed values but uses the unsigned malicious values. An attacker
                with lower-privilege access to the application can inject the username
                of a high-privilege user to impersonate that user.

                which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the "refresh" flow is
                no longer used).

            cve_id: CVE-2021-21405
            summary: 'Lotus is an Implementation of the Filecoin protocol written
                in Go. BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method
                VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: "serialized",
                and "compressed", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either
                of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform
                a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct
                if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for
                blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these
                issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks,
                as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block,
                even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst`
                bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now
                ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they
                are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.'

            cve_id: CVE-2022-31206
            summary: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series,
                NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic
                authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering
                software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native
                machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine
                code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time
                operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not
                seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to
                manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary
                machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context
                of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and
                hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory
                protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code
                execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently
                segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.

                reverting. `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` is not expected
                to revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode`

        CVE-2022-23610:

            summary: wire-server provides back end services for Wire, an open source
                messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release,
                it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and impersonate
                any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML, but without
                SCIM, it was possible to create new accounts with fake SAML credentials.
                Under certain conditions that can be established by an attacker, an
                upstream library for parsing, rendering, signing, and validating SAML
                XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that were provided by
                the attacker in the signature. As a consequence, the attacker could
                login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO enabled. If SCIM
                was not enabled, the attacker could also create new users with new
                SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
                needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team members
                with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app), the
                SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive,
                but usually hard to guess, also visible in Team Management), and the
                SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick). The
                issue has been fixed in wire-server `2022-01-27` and is already deployed
                on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server
                need to be updated to `2022-01-27`, so that their backends are no
                longer affected. There are currently no known workarounds. More detailed
                information about how to reproduce the vulnerability and mitigation
                strategies is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

            summary: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with
                a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used
                in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation
                that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying
                that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk
                before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server
                has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold`
                or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including
                the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as
                those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications
                calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the

            summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before
                0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign
                tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability
                is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard
                for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web
                Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header
                of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker
                could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original
                signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing
                the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with
                the public key embedded in that JWS header.

            summary: TenderMint from version 0.33.0 and before version 0.33.6 allows
                block proposers to include signatures for the wrong block. This may
                happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time
                and restart it (**without changing chainID**). A malicious block proposer
                (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to
                completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6
                which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority
                before creating a commit.

            summary: 'When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication
                is enabled and the ''Validate Identity Provider Certificate'' option
                is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS
                SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker
                to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access
                to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue
                affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0
                versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than

                not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not
                used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the ''Validate
                Identity Provider Certificate'' option is enabled (checked) in the
                SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected
                by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect

                Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and
                Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to
                the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed
                by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact
                on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server.
                An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users.

            cve_id: CVE-2023-23940
            summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart
                contract development written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized
                ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak`
                after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result, any contract using
                `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount`
                preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the
                malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to
                impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched
                in 0.6.1.

                exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution.
        CVE-2023-23928:
            cve_id: CVE-2023-23928
            summary: reason-jose is a JOSE implementation in ReasonML and OCaml.`Jose.Jws.validate`
                does not check HS256 signatures. This allows tampering of JWS header
                and payload data if the service does not perform additional checks.
                Such tampering could expose applications using reason-jose to authorization
                bypass. Applications relying on JWS claims assertion to enforce security
                boundaries may be vulnerable to privilege escalation. This issue has
                been patched in version 0.8.2.

        CVE-2023-22742:
            cve_id: CVE-2023-22742
            summary: libgit2 is a cross-platform, linkable library implementation
                of Git. When using an SSH remote with the optional libssh2 backend,
                libgit2 does not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions
                of libgit2 require the caller to set the `certificate_check` field
                of libgit2's `git_remote_callbacks` structure - if a certificate check
                callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking.
                This means that by default - without configuring a certificate check
                callback, clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys
                and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack. Users are encouraged
                to upgrade to v1.4.5 or v1.5.1. Users unable to upgrade should ensure
                that all relevant certificates are manually checked.

        CVE-2022-46176:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-46176
            summary: Cargo is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG
                was notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification
                when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit
                this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability
                has been assigned CVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo
                before 1.66.1 are vulnerable. Note that even if you don't explicitly
                use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you
                might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git
                to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1]
                setting), as that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through
                SSH. Rust 1.66.1 will ensure Cargo checks the SSH host key and abort
                the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted.
                We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.

            summary: An unprotected memory-access operation in optee_os in TrustedFirmware
                Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE) before 3.20 allows
                a physically proximate adversary to bypass signature verification

        CVE-2022-23507:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-23507
            summary: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine
                for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0
                contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic
                Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and
                related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs,
                Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the
                trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack
                vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that
                satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping
                validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector
                is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit
                it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There
                are no workarounds.

        CVE-2022-39366:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-39366
            summary: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version
                0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service
                (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an
                attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service
                authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService`
                of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`,
                which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature.
                This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm.
                This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains
                a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.

                Due to insufficient policy verification by WARP iOS client, this feature
                could be bypassed by using the "Disable WARP" quick action.
        CVE-2022-39300:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-39300
            summary: node SAML is a SAML 2.0 library based on the SAML implementation
                of passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication
                on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that
                the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element.
                Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without
                access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a
                signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml
                version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be
                done as a workaround.
        CVE-2019-1729:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1729
            summary: A vulnerability in the CLI implementation of a specific command
                used for image maintenance for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an
                authenticated, local attacker to overwrite any file on the file system
                including system files. These file overwrites by the attacker are
                accomplished at the root privilege level. The vulnerability occurs
                because there is no verification of user-input parameters and or digital-signature
                verification for image files when using a specific CLI command. An
                attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
                device and issuing a command at the CLI. Because an exploit could
                allow the attacker to overwrite any file on the disk, including system
                files, a denial of service (DoS) condition could occur. The attacker
                must have valid administrator credentials for the affected device
                to exploit this vulnerability.
        CVE-2019-1728:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-1728
            summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Configuration Validation functionality
                of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated,
                local attacker to run arbitrary commands at system boot time with
                the privileges of root. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper
                validation of system files when the persistent configuration information
                is read from the file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
                by authenticating to the device and overwriting the persistent configuration
                storage with malicious executable files. An exploit could allow the
                attacker to run arbitrary commands at system startup and those commands
                will run as the root user. The attacker must have valid administrative
                credentials for the device.
        CVE-2018-18509:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-18509
            summary: A flaw during verification of certain S/MIME signatures causes
                emails to be shown in Thunderbird as having a valid digital signature,
                even if the shown message contents aren't covered by the signature.
                The flaw allows an attacker to reuse a valid S/MIME signature to craft
                an email message with arbitrary content. This vulnerability affects
                Thunderbird < 60.5.1.
        CVE-2018-7340:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-7340
            summary: Duo Network Gateway 1.2.9 and earlier may incorrectly utilize
                the results of XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such
                a way that an attacker may be able to manipulate the SAML data without
                invalidating the cryptographic signature, allowing the attack to potentially
                bypass authentication to SAML service providers.

            summary: An exploitable vulnerability exists in the verified boot protection
                of the Das U-Boot from version 2013.07-rc1 to 2014.07-rc2. The affected
                versions lack proper FIT signature enforcement, which allows an attacker
                to bypass U-Boot's verified boot and execute an unsigned kernel, embedded
                in a legacy image format. To trigger this vulnerability, a local attacker
                needs to be able to supply the image to boot.

            cve_id: CVE-2019-1615
            summary: 'A vulnerability in the Image Signature Verification feature
                of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
                with administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software
                image on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
                verification of digital signatures for software images. An attacker
                could exploit this vulnerability by loading an unsigned software image

                interaction is required. If no access protection is configured, no
                privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The
                vulnerability could allow causing a denial of service condition of
                the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of
                the system.
        CVE-2018-18203:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-18203
            summary: A vulnerability in the update mechanism of Subaru StarLink Harman
                head units 2017, 2018, and 2019 may give an attacker (with physical
                access to the vehicle's USB ports) the ability to rewrite the firmware
                of the head unit. This occurs because the device accepts modified
                QNX6 filesystem images (as long as the attacker obtains access to
                certain Harman decryption/encryption code) as a consequence of a bug
                where unsigned images pass a validity check. An attacker could potentially
                install persistent malicious head unit firmware and execute arbitrary
                code as the root user.

        CVE-2018-16253:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-16253
            summary: In sig_verify() in x509.c in axTLS version 2.1.3 and before,
                the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification does not properly verify the
                ASN.1 metadata. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures
                when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation
                through fake X.509 certificates. This is an even more permissive variant
                of CVE-2006-4790 and CVE-2014-1568.
        CVE-2018-16150:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-16150
            summary: In sig_verify() in x509.c in axTLS version 2.1.3 and before,
                the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification does not reject excess data
                after the hash value. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures
                when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation
                through fake X.509 certificates. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4340.
        CVE-2018-16149:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-16149
            summary: In sig_verify() in x509.c in axTLS version 2.1.3 and before,
                the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification blindly trusts the declared
                lengths in the ASN.1 structure. Consequently, when small public exponents
                are being used, a remote attacker can generate purposefully crafted
                signatures (and put them on X.509 certificates) to induce illegal
                memory access and crash the verifier.
        CVE-2018-18653:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-18653
            summary: The Linux kernel, as used in Ubuntu 18.10 and when booted with
                UEFI Secure Boot enabled, allows privileged local users to bypass
                intended Secure Boot restrictions and execute untrusted code by loading
                arbitrary kernel modules. This occurs because a modified kernel/module.c,
                in conjunction with certain configuration options, leads to mishandling
                of the result of signature verification.
        CVE-2018-8955:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-8955
            summary: The installer for BitDefender GravityZone relies on an encoded
                string in a filename to determine the URL for installation metadata,
                which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by changing
                the filename while leaving the file's digital signature unchanged.
        CVE-2018-15374:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-15374
            summary: A vulnerability in the Image Verification feature of Cisco IOS
                XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install
                a malicious software image or file on an affected device. The vulnerability
                is due to the affected software improperly verifying digital signatures
                for software images and files that are uploaded to a device. An attacker
                could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious software
                image or file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
                the attacker to bypass digital signature verification checks for software
                images and files and install a malicious software image or file on
                the affected device.
        CVE-2018-16152:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-16152
            summary: In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c in the
                gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation
                based on GMP does not reject excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters
                field during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently, a remote
                attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being
                used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA signature
                is used for IKEv2 authentication. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4790
                and CVE-2014-1568.
        CVE-2018-16151:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-16151
            summary: In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c in the
                gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation
                based on GMP does not reject excess data after the encoded algorithm
                OID during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Similar to the flaw
                in the same version of strongSwan regarding digestAlgorithm.parameters,
                a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents
                are being used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA
                signature is used for IKEv2 authentication.
        CVE-2018-15836:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-15836
            summary: In verify_signed_hash() in lib/liboswkeys/signatures.c in Openswan
                before 2.6.50.1, the RSA implementation does not verify the value
                of padding string during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently,
                a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents
                are being used. IKEv2 signature verification is affected when RAW
                RSA keys are used.
        CVE-2018-16515:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-16515
            summary: Matrix Synapse before 0.33.3.1 allows remote attackers to spoof
                events and possibly have unspecified other impacts by leveraging improper
                transaction and event signature validation.
        CVE-2018-7685:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-7685
            summary: The decoupled download and installation steps in libzypp before
                17.5.0 could lead to a corrupted RPM being left in the cache, where
                a later call would not display the corrupted RPM warning and allow
                installation, a problem caused by malicious warnings only displayed
                during download.
        CVE-2018-0501:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-0501
            summary: The mirror:// method implementation in Advanced Package Tool
                (APT) 1.6.x before 1.6.4 and 1.7.x before 1.7.0~alpha3 mishandles
                gpg signature verification for the InRelease file of a fallback mirror,
                aka mirrorfail.
        CVE-2018-5383:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-5383
            summary: Bluetooth firmware or operating system software drivers in macOS
                versions before 10.13, High Sierra and iOS versions before 11.4, and
                Android versions before the 2018-06-05 patch may not sufficiently
                validate elliptic curve parameters used to generate public keys during
                a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which may allow a remote attacker to
                obtain the encryption key used by the device.
        CVE-2018-5387:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-5387
            summary: Wizkunde SAMLBase may incorrectly utilize the results of XML
                DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker
                may be able to manipulate the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic
                signature, allowing the attack to potentially bypass authentication
                to SAML service providers.
        CVE-2016-9604:
            cve_id: CVE-2016-9604
            summary: It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root
                can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver'
                in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its
                session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification
                by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
        CVE-2017-3198:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-3198
            summary: GIGABYTE BRIX UEFI firmware does not cryptographically validate
                images prior to updating the system firmware. Additionally, the firmware

            summary: An issue was discovered in password-store.sh in pass in Simple
                Password Store 1.7.x before 1.7.2. The signature verification routine
                parses the output of GnuPG with an incomplete regular expression,
                which allows remote attackers to spoof file signatures on configuration
                files and extension scripts. Modifying the configuration file allows
                the attacker to inject additional encryption keys under their control,
                thereby disclosing passwords to the attacker. Modifying the extension
                scripts allows the attacker arbitrary code execution.
        CVE-2018-12019:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-12019
            summary: The signature verification routine in Enigmail before 2.0.7 interprets
                user ids as status/control messages and does not correctly keep track
                of the status of multiple signatures, which allows remote attackers
                to spoof arbitrary email signatures via public keys containing crafted
                primary user ids.
        CVE-2018-10407:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-10407
            summary: An issue was discovered in Carbon Black Cb Response. A maliciously
                crafted Universal/fat binary can evade third-party code signing checks.
                By not completing full inspection of the Universal/fat binary, the
                user of the third-party tool will believe that the code is signed
                by Apple, but the malicious unsigned code will execute.
        CVE-2018-10470:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-10470
            summary: Little Snitch versions 4.0 to 4.0.6 use the SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors()
                function without the kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures flag and therefore
                do not validate all architectures stored in a fat binary. An attacker
                can maliciously craft a fat binary containing multiple architectures
                that may cause a situation where Little Snitch treats the running
                process as having no code signature at all while erroneously indicating
                that the binary on disk does have a valid code signature. This could
                lead to users being confused about whether or not the code signature
                is valid.
        CVE-2017-16005:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-16005
            summary: Http-signature is a "Reference implementation of Joyent's HTTP
                Signature Scheme". In versions <=0.9.11, http-signature signs only
                the header values, but not the header names. This makes http-signature
                vulnerable to header forgery. Thus, if an attacker can intercept a
                request, he can swap header names and change the meaning of the request
                without changing the signature.
        CVE-2016-1000342:

            summary: Use of cryptographically weak PRNG in the password recovery token
                generation of Revive Adserver < v4.2.1 causes a potential authentication
                bypass attack if an attacker exploits the password recovery functionality.
                In lib/OA/Dal/PasswordRecovery.php, the function generateRecoveryId()
                generates a password reset token that relies on the PHP uniqid function
                and consequently depends only on the current server time, which is

                This can be predicted by writing the same random function code in
                an exploit contract to determine the deadSeat value.

            cve_id: CVE-2018-17877
            summary: A lottery smart contract implementation for Greedy 599, an Ethereum
                gambling game, generates a random value that is predictable via an
                external contract call. The developer used the extcodesize() function
                to prevent a malicious contract from being called, but the attacker
                can bypass it by writing the core code in the constructor of their
                exploit code. Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get
                rewards.
        CVE-2018-12975:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-12975
            summary: The random() function of the smart contract implementation for
                CryptoSaga, an Ethereum game, generates a random value with publicly
                readable variables such as timestamp, the current block's blockhash,
                and a private variable (which can be read with a getStorageAt call).
                Therefore, attackers can precompute the random number and manipulate
                the game (e.g., get powerful characters or get critical damages).

            summary: Lightbend Akka 2.5.x before 2.5.16 allows message disclosure
                and modification because of an RNG error. A random number generator
                is used in Akka Remoting for TLS (both classic and Artery Remoting).
                Akka allows configuration of custom random number generators. For
                historical reasons, Akka included the AES128CounterSecureRNG and AES256CounterSecureRNG
                random number generators. The implementations had a bug that caused
                the generated numbers to be repeated after only a few bytes. The custom
                RNG implementations were not configured by default but examples in
                the documentation showed (and therefore implicitly recommended) using
                the custom ones. This can be used by an attacker to compromise the
                communication if these random number generators are enabled in configuration.
                It would be possible to eavesdrop, replay, or modify the messages
                sent with Akka Remoting/Cluster.

            summary: 'A weak randomness in WebCrypto keygen vulnerability exists in
                Node.js 18 due to a change with EntropySource() in SecretKeyGenTraits::DoKeyGen()
                in src/crypto/crypto_keygen.cc. There are two problems with this:
                1) It does not check the return value, it assumes EntropySource()
                always succeeds, but it can (and sometimes will) fail. 2) The random
                data returned byEntropySource() may not be cryptographically strong
                and therefore not suitable as keying material.'

        CVE-2022-44796:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-44796
            summary: An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712.
                The authorization service has a flow that allows getting access to
                the Web UI without knowing credentials. For signing, the JWT token
                uses a secret key that is generated through a function that doesn't
                produce cryptographically strong sequences. An attacker can predict
                these sequences and generate a JWT token. As a result, an attacker
                can get access to the Web UI. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi
                BETA build 1.0.13.1611.

        CVE-2022-36045:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-36045
            summary: NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either
                Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets
                for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`,
                a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB
                (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically
                insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant
                that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations
                of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly
                calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to.
                This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability
                allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement
                of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately
                (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset.
                The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There
                is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully
                patch the vulnerability.
        CVE-2022-33738:

                used to create user session token for the web portal
        CVE-2022-20817:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-20817
            summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Unified IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated,
                remote attacker to impersonate another user's phone if the Cisco Unified
                Communications Manager (CUCM) is in secure mode. This vulnerability
                is due to improper key generation during the manufacturing process
                that could result in duplicated manufactured keys installed on multiple
                devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing
                a machine-in-the-middle attack on the secure communication between
                the phone and the CUCM. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
                to impersonate another user's phone. This vulnerability cannot be
                addressed with software updates. There is a workaround that addresses
                this vulnerability.
        CVE-2022-29245:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-29245
            summary: SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions
                2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the clientâ€™s
                private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is
                not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore
                not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection
                to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key
                is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be
                brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on
                the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch
                for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256`
                and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.
        CVE-2022-26779:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-26779
            summary: Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number
                generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created
                based only on an email address, a random token is generated. An attacker
                with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the invite is sent,
                could generate time deterministic tokens and brute force attempt to
                use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the invite. This
                feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know
                or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation
                token, and the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user
                of CloudStack.
        CVE-2021-36171:

            summary: The use of a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator
                in the password reset feature of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow
                a remote unauthenticated attacker to predict parts of or the whole
                newly generated password within a given time frame.
        CVE-2013-20003:
            cve_id: CVE-2013-20003
            summary: Z-Wave devices from Sierra Designs (circa 2013) and Silicon Labs
                (using S0 security) may use a known, shared network key of all zeros,
                allowing an attacker within radio range to spoof Z-Wave traffic.
        CVE-2021-43799:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-43799
            summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server
                installs RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip
                Server prior to 4.9, the initial installation (until first reboot,
                or restart of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports
                which RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672, the RabbitMQ distribution
                port, which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default "cookie"
                which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG, which limits
                the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality, the
                seed for the randomizer is biased, resulting in approximately 20 bits
                of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not
                protect port 25672, a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits
                of entropy in the "cookie" and leverage it for arbitrary execution
                of code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is
                sent through RabbitMQ, which includes all message traffic sent by
                users. Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround,
                ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from
                outside the Zulip server.

            summary: Telenot CompasX versions prior to 32.0 use a weak seed for random
                number generation leading to predictable AES keys used in the NFC
                tags used for local authorization of users. This may lead to total

                uses an insecure method of creating password reset hashes (based only
                on microtime), which allows an attacker to guess the hash and set
                the password within a few hours by bruteforcing.
        CVE-2019-20138:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-20138
            summary: The HTTP Authentication library before 2019-12-27 for Nim has
                weak password hashing because the default algorithm for libsodium's
                crypto_pwhash_str is not used.

        CVE-2010-2450:
            cve_id: CVE-2010-2450
            summary: The keygen.sh script in Shibboleth SP 2.0 (located in /usr/local/etc/shibboleth
                by default) uses OpenSSL to create a DES private key which is placed
                in sp-key.pm. It relies on the root umask (default 22) instead of
                chmoding the resulting file itself, so the generated private key is
                world readable by default.
        CVE-2019-17216:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-17216
            summary: An issue was discovered on V-Zug Combi-Steam MSLQ devices before
                Ethernet R07 and before WLAN R05. Password authentication uses MD5
                to hash passwords. Cracking is possible with minimal effort.
        CVE-2019-12737:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-12737
            summary: UserHashedTableAuth in JetBrains Ktor framework before 1.2.0-rc

            summary: Moxa IKS and EDS generate a predictable cookie calculated with
                an MD5 hash, allowing an attacker to capture the administrator's password,
                which could lead to a full compromise of the device.
        CVE-2019-7649:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-7649
            summary: global.encryptPassword in bootstrap/global.js in CMSWing 1.3.7
                relies on multiple MD5 operations for password hashing.
        CVE-2019-3907:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-3907
            summary: Premisys Identicard version 3.1.190 stores user credentials and
                other sensitive information with a known weak encryption method (MD5
                hash of a salt and password).
        CVE-2019-0030:
            cve_id: CVE-2019-0030
            summary: Juniper ATP uses DES and a hardcoded salt for password hashing,
                allowing for trivial de-hashing of the password file contents. This
                issue affects Juniper ATP 5.0 versions prior to 5.0.3.
        CVE-2018-15681:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-15681
            summary: An issue was discovered in BTITeam XBTIT 2.5.4. When a user logs
                in, their password hash is rehashed using a predictable salt and stored
                in the "pass" cookie, which is not flagged as HTTPOnly. Due to the
                weak and predictable salt that is in place, an attacker who successfully
                steals this cookie can efficiently brute-force it to retrieve the
                user's cleartext password.
        CVE-2018-15680:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-15680
            summary: An issue was discovered in BTITeam XBTIT 2.5.4. The hashed passwords
                stored in the xbtit_users table are stored as unsalted MD5 hashes,
                which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain cleartext
                values via a brute-force attack.
        CVE-2018-10618:
            cve_id: CVE-2018-10618
            summary: Davolink DVW-3200N all version prior to Version 1.00.06. The
                device generates a weak password hash that is easily cracked, allowing
                a remote attacker to obtain the password for the device.
        CVE-2017-3962:
            cve_id: CVE-2017-3962
            summary: Password recovery exploitation vulnerability in the non-certificate-based
                authentication mechanism in McAfee Network Security Management (NSM)
                before 8.2.7.42.2 allows attackers to crack user passwords via unsalted
                hashes.
        CVE-2023-27580:
            cve_id: CVE-2023-27580
            summary: CodeIgniter Shield provides authentication and authorization
                for the CodeIgniter 4 PHP framework. An improper implementation was
                found in the password storage process. All hashed passwords stored
                in Shield v1.0.0-beta.3 or earlier are easier to crack than expected
                due to the vulnerability. Therefore, they should be removed as soon
                as possible. If an attacker gets (1) the user's hashed password by
                Shield, and (2) the hashed password (SHA-384 hash without salt) from
                somewhere, the attacker may easily crack the user's password. Upgrade
                to Shield v1.0.0-beta.4 or later to fix this issue. After upgrading,
                all users’ hashed passwords should be updated (saved to the database).
                There are no known workarounds.
        CVE-2023-0567:
            cve_id: CVE-2023-0567
            summary: In PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before
                8.2.3, password_verify() function may accept some invalid Blowfish
                hashes as valid. If such invalid hash ever ends up in the password
                database, it may lead to an application allowing any password for
                this entry as valid.
        CVE-2022-26115:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-26115
            summary: A use of password hash with insufficient computational effort
                vulnerability [CWE-916] in FortiSandbox before 4.2.0 may allow an
                attacker with access to the password database to efficiently mount
                bulk guessing attacks to recover the passwords.
        CVE-2022-40258:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-40258

        CVE-2022-47732:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-47732
            summary: In Yeastar N412 and N824 Configuration Panel 42.x and 45.x, an
                unauthenticated attacker can create backup file and download it, revealing
                admin hash, allowing, once cracked, to login inside the Configuration
                Panel, otherwise, replacing the hash in the archive and restoring
                it on the device which will change admin password granting access
                to the device.
        CVE-2020-12069:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-12069
            summary: In Pilz PMC programming tool 3.x before 3.5.17 (based on CODESYS
                Development System), the password-hashing feature requires insufficient
                computational effort.
        CVE-2022-36071:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-36071
            summary: SFTPGo is configurable SFTP server with optional HTTP/S, FTP/S
                and WebDAV support. SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using
                TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication
                factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that
                can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes.
                These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of
                the TOTP. In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery
                codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication.
                An attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate
                some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after
                it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has been
                fixed in version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after
                enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling
                it.
        CVE-2022-31177:
            cve_id: CVE-2022-31177
            summary: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built
                on top of Flask python framework. In versions prior to 4.1.3 an authenticated
                Admin user could query other users by their salted and hashed passwords
                strings. These filters could be made by using partial hashed password
                strings. The response would not include the hashed passwords, but
                an attacker could infer partial password hashes and their respective
                users. This issue has been fixed in version 4.1.3. Users are advised
                to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

                allow an attacker to more easily obtain credentials used for access.
        CVE-2020-16231:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-16231
            summary: The affected Bachmann Electronic M-Base Controllers of version
                MSYS v1.06.14 and later use weak cryptography to protect device passwords.
                Affected controllers that are actively supported include MX207, MX213,
                MX220, MC206, MC212, MC220, and MH230 hardware controllers, and affected
                end-of-life controller include MC205, MC210, MH212, ME203, CS200,

                controllers. Security Level 0 is set at default from the manufacturer,
                which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain access
                to the password hashes. Security Level 4 is susceptible if an authenticated
                remote attacker or an unauthenticated person with physical access
                to the device reads and decrypts the password to conduct further attacks.
        CVE-2022-24041:

                normal (non-FIPS-CC) operational mode. An attacker must have access
                to the account password hashes to take advantage of this weakness
                and can acquire those hashes if they are able to gain access to the
                PAN-OS software configuration. Fixed versions of PAN-OS software use
                a secure cryptographic algorithm for account password hashes. This
                issue does not impact Prisma Access firewalls. This issue impacts:
                PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21; All versions of PAN-OS

        CVE-2021-39182:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-39182
            summary: EnroCrypt is a Python module for encryption and hashing. Prior
                to version 1.1.4, EnroCrypt used the MD5 hashing algorithm in the
                hashing file. Beginners who are unfamiliar with hashes can face problems
                as MD5 is considered an insecure hashing algorithm. The vulnerability
                is patched in v1.1.4 of the product. As a workaround, users can remove
                the `MD5` hashing function from the file `hashing.py`.
        CVE-2021-36767:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-36767
            summary: In Digi RealPort through 4.10.490, authentication relies on a
                challenge-response mechanism that gives access to the server password,
                making the protection ineffective. An attacker may send an unauthenticated
                request to the server. The server will reply with a weakly-hashed
                version of the server's access password. The attacker may then crack
                this hash offline in order to successfully login to the server.

        CVE-2020-25754:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-25754
            summary: An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices.
                There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents
                traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived
                from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number
                can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts
                to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.
        CVE-2021-22741:

                and prior), which could cause the revealing of account credentials
                when server database files are available. Exposure of these files
                to an attacker can make the system vulnerable to password decryption
                attacks. Note that “.sde” configuration export files do not contain
                user account password hashes.
        CVE-2021-33563:

            summary: An issue was discovered on Sannce Smart HD Wifi Security Camera
                EAN 2 950004 595317 devices. A local attacker with the "default" account
                is capable of reading the /etc/passwd file, which contains a weakly
                hashed root password. By taking this hash and cracking it, the attacker
                can obtain root rights on the device.
        CVE-2020-14516:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-14516
            summary: In Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Services Platform Versions
                6.10.00 and 6.11.00, there is an issue with the implementation of
                the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with FactoryTalk Services Platform that
                prevents the user password from being hashed properly.

            summary: Fluxbb 1.5.11 is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability
                by sending an extremely long password via the user login form. When
                a long password is sent, the password hashing process will result
                in CPU and memory exhaustion on the server.
        CVE-2020-10538:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-10538
            summary: An issue was discovered in Epikur before 20.1.1. It stores the
                secret passwords of the users as MD5 hashes in the database. MD5 can
                be brute-forced efficiently and should not be used for such purposes.
                Additionally, since no salt is used, rainbow tables can speed up the
                attack.
        CVE-2020-6780:
            cve_id: CVE-2020-6780

                the database of Bosch FSM-2500 server and Bosch FSM-5000 server up
                to and including version 5.2 allows a remote attacker with admin privileges
                to dump the credentials of other users and possibly recover their
                plain-text passwords by brute-forcing the MD5 hash.
        CVE-2021-21253:
            cve_id: CVE-2021-21253
            summary: OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub.
                OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without
                a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there
                is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt,
                it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using
                dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords.
                This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly
                generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect
                passwords stored in the voting system.
