- cwe_id: CWE-261
  description: Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/261.html

- cwe_id: CWE-310
  description: Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html

- cwe_id: CWE-321
  description: The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html

- cwe_id: CWE-324
  description: The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/324.html

- cwe_id: CWE-325
  description: The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/325.html

- cwe_id: CWE-326
  description: The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html

- cwe_id: CWE-327
  description: The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html

- cwe_id: CWE-328
  description: The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html

- cwe_id: CWE-329
  description: The product generates and uses a predictable initialization Vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, which causes algorithms to be susceptible to dictionary attacks when they are encrypted under the same key.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/329.html

- cwe_id: CWE-330
  description: The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html

- cwe_id: CWE-331
  description: The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331.html

- cwe_id: CWE-334
  description: The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/334.html

- cwe_id: CWE-335
  description: The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/335.html

- cwe_id: CWE-338
  description: The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html

- cwe_id: CWE-347
  description: The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html

- cwe_id: CWE-635
  description: CWE nodes in this view (slice) were used by NIST to categorize vulnerabilities within NVD, from 2008 to 2016. This original version has been used by many other projects.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/635.html

- cwe_id: CWE-699
  description: This view organizes weaknesses around concepts that are frequently used or encountered in software development. This includes all aspects of the software development lifecycle including both architecture and implementation. Accordingly, this view can align closely with the perspectives of architects, developers, educators, and assessment vendors. It provides a variety of categories that are intended to simplify navigation, browsing, and mapping.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html

- cwe_id: CWE-916
  description: The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.
  url: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html

- cwe_id: CWE-1240
  description: To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.
